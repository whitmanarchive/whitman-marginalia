            EdmundEdmund SpenserSpenser:
            born about 1553—died 1599.
            
            was an intimate friend of Sydney (Philip)
            who was killed by a wound at the
            battle of Zutphen
            
            Wrote adulatory verses on Queen
            Elizabeth—"(great Gloriane,)"
            
            Raleigh was Spenser's next friend,
            after Sydney.
            
            had a pension of £50 from the Queen,
            and the actual Laureateship
            
            he danced attendance, like a lackey, for
            a long time at court,—but without
            luck.—He left in disgust at last,
            and went to his Irish estate, on
            the banks of the Mulla
            
            Earl Leicester was his patron and
            friend—
            
            The E.K. often mentioned by Spenser
            is supposed to have been himself
            —E.K. has much to say of Spenser's
            writings—commends them.—
            
            Spenser took his degrees of B.A. and
                Ma.A. at Cambridge in 1573 &amp; 1576
            
            after serving in an Irish secretaryship
            received from the Queen the profitable
            grant of property, the Abbey of
            Enniscorthy in the county of Wexford,
            —making the poet rich—owner of and resident
            in Kilcolman castle.
            
            There in his castle he must
            have written  or finished in 1588-9—the
            Fairy Queen—it was published
            in 1590—("twelve books fashioning twelve  moral virtues")
            
            was married when 40 (or over)
            
            Kilcoman castle attacked by insurgents.—
            Spenser and his family fled—one of
            his children burned to death—the
            castle being fired.—
            
            A flight from Ireland—
            Poverty ensued.—comparative poverty anyhow
            
            Lived a year in London
            
            Died—was buried in Westminster Abbey.
            —a monument erected, 30 years after death,
            by Anne, Countess of Dorset.
            
            In his poems, reverence for a purity
            and goodness, is paramount to all
            the rest.—
            
            In person Spenser was small
            and delicate, and in costume
            precise, "as became a man of taste."
            His face had sweetness &amp; refinement
            —mild almond‑shaped eyes,—forehead
            lofty, but not very wide—was
            well beloved by contemporaries
            —who all exempted him from
            satire
            
            Tone of Spenser's poetry is unworldly,
            abstracted, contemplative in the
            highest degree—loving high themes—
            princeliness, purity, white garments,
            —rather averse to reality—his
            personages being only half‑real—
            —He is haunted by a morbid refinement
            of beauty—beauty three times washed
            and strained—
            
            No doubt but he was very learned.—
            
            Even at the time of writing them, Spenser's
            words, in his poems, were many of
            them unusual, obsolete, or considered
            affected and strained.
            
            Fairy Queen—personages,
                Red Cross Knight—"Holiness"
                Una—"Truth"
                Sans foy—"Faithless"
                Arthur—Magnanimity—
                Orgoglio—"Pride"
                Gloriana—Glory—Queen Elizabeth
            In the F.Q. are also Despair, Fear, Care,
            and Mammon.—
            First book—a king's daughter applies to a
            knight—her parents are confined in their castle
            —a vast and terrible dragon has laid
            in wait todevouring the country, and is
            now after them—The knight sets
            forth, encounters a monster, an
            enchanter, kills the dragon, delivers
            the king &amp; queen, marries the daughter.—
