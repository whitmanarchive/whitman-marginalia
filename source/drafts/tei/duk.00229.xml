As in Beethoven's matchless music there runs <hi rend="underline" hand="h1">one idea, worked out through all the changes of measure and of key, now almost hidden, <note type="authorial" place="marginright" hand="h1">&#9756;</note>now breaking out in rich natural melody, whispered in the treble, murmured in the base, dimly suggested in the prelude</hi>, but growing clearer and clearer as the work proceeds, winding <orig reg="gradually">grad-ually</orig> back, until it ends in the key in which it began, and closes in triumphant harmony; so throughout the whole Bible, there runs one great idea&#8212;man's ruin by sin, and his redemption by grace; in a word, Jesus Christ, the Saviour. This runs through the Old Testament, that prelude to the New, dimly promised at the fall, and more clearly to Abraham; typified in the ceremonies of the law; all the events of sacred history paving the way for his <orig reg="coming">com-ing</orig>; his descent proved in the genealogies of Ruth and Chronicles; spoken of as Shiloh by Jacob, as the Star of Balaam, as the Prophet by Moses; the David of Psalms; the Redeemer looked for by Job; the Beloved of the Song of Songs. We find him in the sublime strains of the lofty Isaiah; in the writings of the <orig reg="tender">ten-der</orig> Jeremiah; in the mysteries of the contemplative Ezekiel; in the visions of the beloved Daniel; the great idea growing clearer and clearer as the time drew on. Then the full harmony broke out in the song of the angels, "Glory to God in the highest; on earth peace, good-will towards men." And Evangelists and Apostles taking up the theme, the strain closes in the same key in which it began; the devil, who troubles the first paradise, forever excluded from the second; man restored to the favor of God; and Jesus Christ the key-note of the whole.&#8212;<hi rend="italic">American Messenger</hi>.</p>
