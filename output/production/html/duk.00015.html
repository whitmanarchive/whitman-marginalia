            The Iliad

            in a certain sense.—
            The Paradise 
            Lost is offensive to modern 
            science and intelligence—it is a

                have become of the Seventh Book? This is now occupied with describing the
                Six Days of Creation. A few verses of the First Chapter of Genesis extended
                into so many hundred lines. The Book, as it stands, has full poetical reason. First,
                it has a sufficient motive. It founds the existence of Adam and Eve, which is
                otherwise not duly led to. The revolted Angels, you know, have fallen, and the
                Almighty will create a new race of worshippers to supply their place—Mankind.</p></span>

                <p class="tei_p">I initiated you into Milton nearly thirty years ago, my dear Seward; and I
                rejoice to find that you still have him by heart. Between the fall of the
                Angels, and that inhabiting of Paradise by our first parents, which is
                largely related by Raphael, there would be in the history which the poem
                undertakes, an unfilled gap and blank without this book. The chain of events
                which is unrolled would be broken—interrupted—incomplete.</p></span>
            <span class="tei_sp"><span class="tei_speaker">SEWARD.</span>
                <p class="tei_p">And, sir, when Raphael has told the Rebellion and Fall of the Angels,
                Adam, with a natural movement of curiosity, asks of this "Divine Interpreter"
                how this frame of things began?</p></span>
            <span class="tei_sp"><span class="tei_speaker">NORTH.</span>
                <p class="tei_p">And Raphael answers by declaring at large the Purpose and the Manner.
                The Mission of Raphael is to strengthen, if it be practicable, the Human
                Pair in their obedience. To this end, how apt his discourse, showing how
                dear they are to the Universal Maker, how eminent in his Universe!</p></span>

                <p class="tei_p">The causes, then, of the Archangelic Narrative abound. And the personal
                interest with which the Two Auditors must hear such a revelation of wonders
                from such a Speaker, and that so intimately concerns themselves, falls nothing
                short of what Poetry justly requires in relations put into the mouth of the
                poetical Persons.</p></span>

                answering Propositions, that the Will of Man spontaneously consorting with
                God's Will is Man's Good, spontaneously dissenting, Man's Evil. This is
                created into an awful and solemn narrative of a Matter exactly adapted, and
                long since authoritatively told. But this Truth, springing up in the shape of
                narrative, will now take its own determination into Events of unsurpassed
                magnitude, now of the tenderest individuality and minuteness; and all is,
                hence, in keeping—as one power of life springs up on one spot, in oak-tree,
                moss, and violet, and the difference of stature, thus understood, gives a deep
                harmony, so deep and embracing, that none without injury to the whole could
