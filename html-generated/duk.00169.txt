                Grier estimates that this was written in 1855 or 1856, but the clipping (in two fragments, pasted down) is dated 1857 (Walt Whitman: Notebooks and Unpublished Manuscripts, ed.

            Whereat are inextricable from the British poets are The ideas of royalty and aristocracy, the ideas
            of the  radical separation division of those who serve from those who are
            served, and of the idea a continual recognition of the
                great leading principles that lie spread at the bases
            of monarchicaly institutions and the societies and
                beliefs of the caste. nations.— Always and in In the continents

            or to that order the order of noblemen and courts.— In The skald, the
            harper, the th troubadour, Shakespeare, the feudal minstrel,

            their behest, and for the honor and largesse
            they gave.—Shakespeare wrote composed altogether
            for the court and for the young  nobility and the
            gentry—; he had no other audiences.— The courts hasve at all times
            pensioned eminent poets, and does do so to
            this day.—..... In all times and in all
            nations it has been the faith of
            poets to believe in   the noblest thoughts
            and deeds and to express them and to
            diffuse the love of beauty.—In this we inherit and partake of every one, without distinction of parties or place. In this
            is the common glory of poets, irrespective
            of period or place.—In this the good
            of any one is the good of all—.....

                            STATUESQUE DESCRIPTION.
                            COWPER, at the conclusion of his poem, "Yardly
                                Oak," has a rare poetic image, producing an effect
                                in verse which a sculptor might envy for his
                                marble. The poem itself is but a fragment—one
                                of the last great undertakings of the poet, commenced
                                at the age of sixty. It celebrates an old
                                tree, of the date of the Norman conquest, in Yardly
                                Chase, within walking distance of Olney, and
                                we may suppose the poet often to have visited it.
                                Fancy introduces us to the early life of the tree:
                                "Autumnal rains
                                Beneath thy parent tree mellowed the soil,
            
                
                    
                        
                            
                            Designed thy cradle; and a skipping deer,
                                With pointed hoof, dibbling the glebe, prepared
                                The soft receptacle, in which, secure,
                                Thy rudiments should sleep the winter through."
                            The verse becomes knotted with the stubborn
                                strength of the giant oak:
                                "Time was, when, settling on thy leaf, a fly
                                Could shake thee to the root—and time has been
                                When tempests could not. At thy primest age
                                Thou hadst within thy bole solid contents,
                                That might have ribb'dribbed the sides and plank'dplanked the deck
                                Of some flagg'dflagged admiral; and tortuous arms,
                                The shipwright's darling treasure, didst present
                                To the four-quarter'dquartered winds, robust and bold,
                                Warp'dWarped into tough knee-timber, many a load!"
                            We come to the concluding passage—one of the
                                grandest COWPER ever wrote. We may imagine
                                him spell-bound by the image he had created, despairing
                                of continuing the work. It is a vision of
                                Adam in Paradise:
                                "One man alone, the father of us all,
                                Drew not his life from woman; never gazed,
                                With mute unconsciousness of what he saw,
                                On all around him; learn'dlearned not by degrees,
                                Nor owed articulation to his ear;
                                But, moulded by his Maker into man
                                At once, upstood intelligent, survey'dsurveyed
                                All creatures with precision, understood
                                Their purport, uses, properties, assign'dassigned
                                To each his name significant, and, fill'dfilled
                                With love and wisdom, rendered back to Heaven,
                                In praise harmonious, the first air he drew.
                                He was excused the penalties of dull
                                Minority. No tutor charged his hand
                                With the thought-tracing quill, or task'dtasked his mind
                                With problems. History, not wanted yet,

                                Eventful, should supply her with a theme."
