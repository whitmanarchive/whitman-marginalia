        Alexander Smith's Poems—"A Life
            Drama," and minor pieces.—
        
        There is one electric passage in
        this poetry, where the announcement
        is made of a great forthcoming
        Poet, and the illustration given of
        a king who, about dying, plunges
        his sword into his favorite attendant,
        to send him on before.—
        Alexander Smith is imbued
        with the nature of Tennyson. a
        good deal.—He is full of what
        are called poetical images—full
        of conceits and likenesses;—in
        this respect copying after Shakespeare
        and the majority of the received
        poets.—He seems to be neither
        better or worse than the high
        average.—
        Bayard Taylor's poems more
            resemble N.P. Willis's than any
            others.—They are polished, oriental,
            sentimental, and have as attribute what
            so may be called their psychology—
            you cannot see very plainly at times what
            they mean, although the poet evidently has a meaning
