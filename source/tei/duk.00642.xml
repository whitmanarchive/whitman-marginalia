                             <p>"Yes," said old democratic Walt Whitman
                             to a gentleman connected with T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> P<hi rend="smallcaps">RESS</hi>,
                             seated in the parlor of his little brown wooden
                             house in Camden the other day, "I may vote
                             for Blaine&#8212;undoubtedly shall&#8212;and yet I am
                             an out and out opponent of the high tariff
                             system, and respect and admire Governor
                             Cleveland personally. They say Blaine is a
                             mighty good fellow. Did you ever meet him
                             much personally? He is a large man, isn't
                             he?"</p>
                             <p>"Rather large; he is above the medium
                             height, broad shouldered, in excellent health,
                             and is a jolly good fellow, physically and
                             mentally."</p>
                             <p>"So my friends tell me, but I never met
                             him."</p>
                             <p>"Don't you think, Mr. Whitman, there
                             was something commendable in Mr. Blaine's
                             South American policy?"</p>
                             <p xml:id="p1a" next="#p1b">"I do, decidedly. The United States, as
                             the biggest and eldest brother, may well come
                             forward and say to the South American
                             states, 'Let us all form a bond of union, not
                             only to increase our prosperity in a commercial
                             point of view, but to resent and resist anything
                             like foreign aggression.' I think no
                             American can object to it. I believe Blaine
                             is going to be elected. He will then come
                             out well, I have no doubt. When a man
                             is made President he soon gets a profound
                             sense of his responsibilities, and an earnest
                             desire to render his country good service. In
                             looking back over the list, I cannot think of
                             a single President who did not do the best he</p>

                            occurred. Even Fillmore, Buchanan and
                            Andrew Johnson must be given the credit of
                            patriotic intentions, whatever errors they

                            <p>Mr. Whitman, in cheeriness and good
                            heart at any rate, is a man who does not
                            seem to age rapidly. A series of paralytic
                            strokes, received in Washington soon after
                            the close of the Secession War, while he was a
                            clerk in the Attorney-General's office under
                            Grant's administration&#8212;the result of over
                            two years' exhaustive personal labor in the
                            army hospitals and on the field&#8212;destroyed
                            his activity to some extent, but he has recuperated,
                            and now manages, with the aid of
                            a cane, to take an occasional short walk. He
                            still wields the pen in moderation.</p>
                            <p>In appearance and conversation he is much
                            the same as the Walt Whitman of fourteen
                            years ago. He is one of the cluster of writers
                            engaged to furnish the living history of the
                            Secession War, now just begun by General
                            Beauregard in "The Century." Whitman is
                            to write the Army Hospital article. He said
                            to the writer, half in jest, he should write
                            the Indian Summer of his poetry yet, if life
                            and health are spared.</p>
