            Of Insanity—some are affected with melan‑
            choliamelancholia—in these, the organ of cautiousness will
                be found large: Some fancy themselves the Deity—
                in these Self‑Esteem predominates:—Some are
                furious—in these Destructiveness, or (more likely)
                Combativeness.—But a small organ may become
                diseased, and often does so.
            The Temperaments—four—lymphatic, sanguine,
                bilious, and nervous.—Depend on the condition of particular
                systems of the body.—Brain and nerves predominantly active
                seem to produce the nervous temperament.—The lungs
                and blood vessels being constitutionally predominant give
                rise to the sanguine.—The muscular and fibrous systems
                being predominant give rise to the bilious, (which
                should more properly be called the fibrous,) temperament.
                The predominance of the glands and assimilating organs
                give rise to the lymphatic.—
            Lymphatic.—round form, soft muscle, fair hair, pale skin,
                sleepy eyes, inexpressive face.—Brain languid—other organs ditto.
                The system—a great manufactory of fat.
            Sanguine—well‑defined form—moderate plumpness—firm
                flesh—chestnut hair—blue eyes—fair complexion—great fondness
                for exercise and air—Brain active.—
            Bilious, (Judas in Lord's supper,) black hair, dark skin, moderate
                stoutness, firm flesh, harsh features—great endurance and
                bottom—
            Nervous—fine thin hair—small muscles—thin skin—pale
            countenance—bright eyes—great mental vivacity
            These temperaments are seldom found pure, almost always
                mixed—as nervous &amp; bilious, in Lord Brougham.—This nobleman
                was engaged in a Court of Law all day—went to House of Commons at
                evening, remained there till 2 in the morning—went home, wrote an article for
                Edinburgh Review—then went again to Court—then again to House of
                Commons—and only toward the next morning to bed—his vigor having been
                unabated
            
            
                
                    
                        
                            
                            consequences of that exaltation of life producible
                            by physiological living; and if so, the objective or
                            exterior results are indirect and secondary.
                            How? In this way: When, reader, you or I
                                meet with a person in whom the life-power is at
                                "flood tide," and we will suppose at the moment
                                more voluminous than in ourselves, our perception
                                and consciousness immediately certify to us the
                                fact. We say, or feel within ourselves, "There is
                                more force, more capability, MORE MAN, or MORE
                                WOMAN than I now represent." And it is simply
                                in accordance with a law of our mind that we feel
                                a sense of awe toward this superior energy; as we
                                do while looking on a hissing locomotive, a steamship
                                plowing the waves, a bellowing thunder-cloud,
                                a tornado, or a cataract. To the possessor of such
                                energy, therefore, we defer, bow, submit—perhaps
                                even shrink from him, or catch ourselves in being
                                involuntarily vile to him. When, however, we
                                are ourselves  superior energy, perception and
                                consciousness  none the less expeditious in informing
                                us of that fact. We at once feel that we
                                rise above our fellow, that we outweigh and outvalue
                                him (in power, that is); that we are now
                                MORE than he: and because we know ourselves
                                thus far we know him, and feel that he must now,
                                by his nature, defer and succumb to us. To say
                                truth, there is a pleasure in this consciousness of
                                innate superiority, that, however innocent in intention,
                                however generous in feeling, or however unconscious
                                or ignorant its possessor may be, will
                                cause him to show in his bearing, tone, or some
                                other indescribable effluence of himself, the exisexistence
            
                
                    
                        
                            
                            ence of the fact, and to be, in some way, in spite
                            of himself, an embodied hint of the relative positions
                            growing out of the fact. Thus the whole explanation
                                may be interior. A is within himself
                                exalted by the accumulation of his life and soul:
                                he feels this, and can not, if he would, avoid showing
                                it. B perceives the superior power of his fellow;
                                he feels his own relative weakness, and can
                                not, if he would, avoid being humbled by it.
                            He in whom life culminates, receives the exaltation
                            in every part of his structure, and in every
                            faculty of his being. Every person who has
                                reached years of reflection, and has had his thoughts
                                called to the subject, knows that the course we
                                have already pointed out is capable of accomplishing
                                all this; every such person has seen and has
                                reflected on one or more of these results. We need
                                only say that the effects referred to are seen in the
                                muscular system; so that the individual can lift a
                                greater load, and work longer and more effectively;
                                that they are seen in the action of all the organs,
                                the secretions being more plentiful, or at least more
                                normal, and all the functions more vigorously performed;
                                that they are seen in acuter, more delicate,
                                and perfect sensations; in keener, more complete,
                                and truthful perceptions; in a more healthful consciousness;
                                a more varied and retentive memory;
                                more deep, and yet more correct and natural feelings;
                                more clear conception of rights, principles,
                                and duties, and a more prompt, comprehensive,
                                direct, profound, and pertinent action of the reasoning
                                faculties. We do not mean that ever so much
                                augmentation of life-power can create a single
                                faculty not possessed, or at once strengthen any
                                when feeble. We do mean to say it will bring
                                each faculty up to the highest perfection of which
            
                
                    
                        
                        its inherited stength and healthfulness allow; and
                            that, in many cases, is doing very much. There is
                            intellectual, moral, and physical force-possibility in
                            the world enough to amaze us if it were all brought
                            out; to say nothing of the vast deal that is brought
                            out and apparent, but not usefully applied. Well
                            has one said, "It is more wonderful what mankind
                            have not, than what they have, accomplished!"
                            But there are also moral causes that greatly influence
                                the effective power of individuals. All
                                know how fear takes away strength of muscle and
                                force of thought. all about a Locomotive
                                ☝
                                "Our doubts are traitors,
                                    And make us lose the good we oft might win,
                                    By fearing to attempt."
                                And still more strikingly Othello says: "Every
                                puny whipster gets my sword: for why should
                                honor outlive honesty?" That is to say, the consciousness
                                of guilt or dishonor robs the arm of its
                                energy and the soul of its forcefulness. Even artificial
                                distinctions are known to have the same effect
                                to an extent that is suprising; we may go
                                farther and say, that is needless, and that will,
                                when mankind have at length learned to esteem
                                the man above his accidents, be very greatly restricted.
                                As it now is, we behold too often the
                                astonishing sight of a man or woman full of soul
                                and sense, and who is really the superior, cowering
                                before a fellow-human whose force consists in
                                fashionable or costly apparel—the very covering of
                                the body's shame being thus made a foundation for
                                pride; and the gaudy stuffs upon the back being
                                confessed to be more than moral or social virtues,
                                intellectual power or manliness! A larger knowledge
                                and a true independence will change all this.
                                Similar remarks might be made respecting the
                                tyranny of wealth, hereditary privilege, and official
                                position over the true inner manhood.
                            But all these are factitious forces, resting only on
                            the ignorance and servility of those who suffer
                            their influence, and not springing as positive, self-existent,
                                and controlling energies within the mind
                                of their possessor. Hence they can only survive
                                until the million have learned the true source and
                                quality of all real forcefulness—namely, the mind
                                or soul. Wealth and station may possibly subsist
                                forever as now, in iniquitous (the word means unequal)
                                distribution; but if they do, they will one
                                day have lost their chief social value, from the fact
                                that men will have learned to direct their gaze in
                                all cases beneath, not upon, the surface; and outside

                            The practical deductions to be drawn from this
                                view of our subject are too obvious to require more
                                than mentioning. They are, first, that the benefits
                                to be thus attained must amply repay to any person
                                the time and labor spent upon the study and practice
            
                
                    
                        
                            
                            of self-control, and of habits of physiological
                            living, including exercise that is actual, active, and
                                blood-stirring; and secondly, that he who from
                                these sources would secure (the highest effective
                                personality, must guard against unfavorable moral
                                and factitious influences—as fear, anxiety, impatience,
                                dishonor, and dishonesty; and against th
                                assumptions of wealth, rank, and authority. He
                                must be plus, so far as possible, to all with whom
                                he comes in contact.
