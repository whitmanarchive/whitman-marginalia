                Grier claims that Whitman paraphrased Joseph Gostwick's literal translation of the Nibelungenlied in German Literature (Philadelphia, 1854) probably "in 1858 or slightly later" (Walt Whitman: Notebooks and Unpublished Manuscripts, ed. Edward F. Grier [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 5:1818).

            Our own account of this poem, "the
            German Iliad," being but a fragment, and more
            intended to give furnish the reader, in one or two speci‑
                mensspecimens, a glimpse of the old verses, by a free
            translation of them, we refer those who a desire
                a fuller complete resumé of the Nibelungen, to
            Carlyle's article essay of that name—to which, however, we
            are not indebted for our own article in any particular.—
            The translations we give are original in this article.—
            
            Like all the poems productions of the nearlier northern
            bards, German or Scandinavian, the
            poem is not subjective but eminently
            objective.—TIt gives definite characters, —good or bad,— it relates
                what is done or said.—All is narrative;
            no sentiment, or reflection, or corollary.—
                ¶ We have said that the spinal chara strength
                of the connection of the piece is Pagan;
            yet, in as we have it, many of a clumsy
            attempt is made to Christianize the
            many of the characters.— Some of The
            knights go to mass; and there is, in
            general, the same change as has been that
                attempted with some of the old archi‑
                tecturearchitecture and sculptures in Rome, by
            chopping off a little here and there,
            and changing altering the names from Jupiter
                and or Mars or and Minerva to St. Peter and St. Michael
                and the Virgin Mary.—
            
            
            2
            Before the vesper hour, lo! a great movement
            of knights in the court‑yard,
            To engage in a tournament, for the
            royal pastime.—
            Looking on, among the rest, there sat the
            two wealthy queens,
            And talked of the heroes most worthy
            of praise.
            Then said the beautiful Queen Kriemhilde,
            "My husband ins the most noble, and by
            right this kingdom, and the rule
            of it, is his."
            Then said the lady Brunhilde, "Nay,
            The King, your brother, is most noble—If none were
            living but you and your man,
            Then it what you say might be—but not while
            Gunther lives."
            
            
            3
            First went the queen to Hagen, and, looking upon
            him with hatred,
            "Restore," said she, "before it is too late, my
            Nibelungen treasure,
            Then Gunther and yourself may freely return to your
            own country."
            Then out spoke Hagen, perfectly fearless,
            "It is in vain, for I have sworn that the
            treasure shall remain buried,
            As long as any one of Gunther's royal family
            is alive;
            Therefore ask me no more—but do with
            me what you will."
            Then turning to a follower, Kriemhilde
            commanded him
            To go to the cell where Gunther was
            imprisoned, and deispatch him, and
            bring the head thither.
            Soon Hagen, with horror, with distress in
            his heart,
            Saw the servant appear, with the bloody
            head of Kriemhilde's brother.
            He looked at it a moment, and then with
            stern resolution, to the queen
            "Gunther," said he, "is dead—and Gernot
            and Giselher, thy brothers all, are dead,
            And I shall soon follow them—yet,
            she‑wolf,
            I tell you not the hiding‑place of
            the gold and gems."
            
            
            4
            "So be it, then," said Kriemhilde, "one useful
            thing, at any rate, you have restored
            to me,
            The sword, the weapon of my noble Seigfried."
            With that, she drew Seigfried's sword from
            the scabbard,
            And struck off the hero's head with her
            own hands,
            And Etzel cried aloud in horror, to
            see what was done.
            And at the same time, ancient Hildebrand,
            risin springing to his feet, cried
            Cried, Exclaimed, in frenzy, "Shall such a warrior
            fall by the hand of a woman?
            Then thus I revenge him!"
            And swiftly drawing a dagger, he smote
            the queen in the side,
            And Kriemhilde fell, dying, and her
            kinspeople gathered round her.
            
            Thus, wWithout avail, therefore,  ran was shed the blood of
            many valiant princes, and their
            followers
            And over the dying and lost and the dead, Dietrich
            and Etzel, left alone, lamented.
            Thus love doth evermore bring dole
            and sorrow,
            And thus ends the Song of the
            Nibelungen.—
