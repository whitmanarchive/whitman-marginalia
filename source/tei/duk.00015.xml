            <p>I see in the Iliad the love of Homer to Greece and to humankind. He was
            a legislator to Greece before Solon and Lycurgus&#8212;greater than either&#8212;after

                &#8212;who are Christendom.</p></sp> <note type="authorial" place="right" resp="#h1" xml:id="n1" next="#n2">The Paradise Lost is (to us,) 
            nonsense, any how, because 
            it takes themes entirely out 
            of human cognizance and 
            treats them 
            as Homer treats his 
            siege and

            and then

            The Iliad 
            stands perfectly 
            well and very 
            beautiful for 
            what it is, 
            an appropriate 
            blooming of the 
            poet and what he 
            had received 
            and what he believed,

            The Paradise 
            Lost is offensive to modern 
            science and intelligence&#8212;it is a 
            poetical fanaticism, with a few 
            great strong features, but not a 
            great poem.&#8212; <hi rend="circled">over</hi></note>

                <p>The Iliad has been called a Song of War. I see in it&#8212;a Song of Peace.

                <p>It could never have been, by human power, <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Paradise Lost. What would
                have become of the Seventh Book? This is now occupied with describing the
                Six Days of Creation. A few verses of the First Chapter of Genesis extended
                into so many hundred lines. The Book, as it stands, has full poetical reason. First,
                it has a sufficient motive. It founds the existence of Adam and Eve, which is
                otherwise not duly led to. The revolted Angels, you know, have fallen, and the
                Almighty will create a new race of worshippers to supply their place&#8212;Mankind.</p></sp>
            <sp><speaker>SEWARD.</speaker>
                <p>For this race that is to be created, a Home is previously to be built&#8212;or
                this World is to be created.</p></sp>
            <sp><speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
                <p>I initiated you into Milton nearly thirty years ago, my dear Seward; and I
                rejoice to find that you still have him by heart. Between the fall of the
                Angels, and that inhabiting of Paradise by our first parents, which is
                largely related by Raphael, there would be in the history which the poem
                undertakes, an unfilled gap and blank without this book. The chain of events
                which is unrolled would be broken&#8212;interrupted&#8212;incomplete.</p></sp>
            <sp><speaker>SEWARD.</speaker>
                <p>And, sir, when Raphael has told the Rebellion and Fall of the Angels,
                Adam, with a natural movement of curiosity, asks of this "Divine Interpreter"
                how this frame of things began?</p></sp>
            <sp><speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
                <p>And Raphael answers by declaring at large the Purpose and the Manner.
                The Mission of Raphael is to strengthen, if it be practicable, the Human
                Pair in their obedience. To this end, how apt his discourse, showing how
                dear they are to the Universal Maker, how eminent in his Universe!</p></sp>
            <sp><speaker>SEWARD.</speaker>
                <p>The causes, then, of the Archangelic Narrative abound. And the personal
                interest with which the Two Auditors must hear such a revelation of wonders
                from such a Speaker, and that so intimately concerns themselves, falls nothing
                short of what Poetry justly requires in relations put into the mouth of the
                poetical Persons.</p></sp>

                &#8212;be sustained throughout? The answer is triumphant. The Book is, from
                beginning to end, a stream of the most beautiful descriptive Poetry that
                exists. Not however, mind you, Seward, of stationary description.</p></sp>

            <sp><speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
                <p>Lord Bacon said that Poetry&#8212;that is, Feigned History&#8212;might be worded in

                But hear me a moment longer. Wordsworth, in his famous Preface to the Lyrical
                Ballads, asserts that the language of Prose and the language of Verse differ

                as I am able to understand his Proposition, against his own Theory of writing,
                Verse maintains, as by the laws of our insuppressible nature it always

                <p>Epos is Human History in its magnitude in Verse. In Prose, National
                History offers itself in parallelism. The coincidence is broad and unquestioned;
                but on closer inspection, differences great and innumerable spring up
                and unfold themselves, until at last you might almost persuade yourself that
                the first striking resemblance deceived you, and that the two species lack
                analogy, so many other kinds does the Species in Verse embosom, and so
                escaping are the lines of agreement in the instant in which you attempt fixing

                of God, and, in particular, his Government of Man. The Poem is, therefore,
                Theological, Argumentative, Didactic, in Epic Form. Being in the constitution
                of his soul a Poet, mightiest of the mighty, the intention is hidden
                in the Form. The Verse has transformed the matter. Now, then, the
                Paradise Lost is not history told for itself. But this One Truth, in two
                answering Propositions, that the Will of Man spontaneously consorting with
                God's Will is Man's Good, spontaneously dissenting, Man's Evil. This is
                created into an awful and solemn narrative of a Matter exactly adapted, and
                long since authoritatively told. But this Truth, springing up in the shape of
                narrative, will now take its own determination into Events of unsurpassed
                magnitude, now of the tenderest individuality and minuteness; and all is,
                hence, in keeping&#8212;as one power of life springs up on one spot, in oak-tree,
                moss, and violet, and the difference of stature, thus understood, gives a deep
                harmony, so deep and embracing, that none without injury to the whole could
