    <p class="tei_p">Whitman's marginalia on reviews and essays about British writers shed light on his early development in a mysterious period, what Ralph Waldo Emerson called the "long foreground" of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>.<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n1 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n1"><span>My remarks here repurpose and reaffirm (in a much broader context now of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman Archive</span> work on Whitman's annotations) my earlier treatment in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Tradition: The Poet in His Century</span> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990). Emerson's comment was made in his famous letter of greeting to Whitman and is available in many places, including in an <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/LG/1856/poems/33">appendix to the second edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span></a>. </span></span>  Still signing himself "Walter Whitman," the young autodidact already had begun to take on the perspectives and self-assurance of "Walt." In short, before the poet had produced any memorable writing, he nonetheless displayed a remarkable confidence, an attitude that easily could be misunderstood.  In fact, some critics have scolded Whitman's lack of deference. Larzer Ziff, for example, complained of the "tastelessness of his all-too-easy dismissal of certain British authors."<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n2 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n2"><span>Larzer Ziff, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Literary Democracy: The Declaration of Cultural Independence in America</span> (New York: The Viking Press, 1981), 246. </span></span></p>

    <div class="tei_p p">Yet adopting a pose of being rude, vulgar, uncouth, and "one of the roughs" was vital for Whitman's poetic persona and for the bold agenda he set for himself. In the early 1850s, he carved out a space for a distinctively American poetry by depicting British poets as shaped by ennui and aristocracy, as he said of Tennyson in one anonymous 1855 review of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. The poet laureate Tennyson

Both have the same supercilious elegance, both love the reminiscences which extol caste, both agree on the topics proper for mention and discussion, both hold the same undertone of church and state, both have the same languishing melancholy and irony, . . . both are silent on the presumptions of liberty and equality, and both devour themselves in solitary lassitude."<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n3 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n3"><span>[Walt Whitman], <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/lg1855/anc.00014.html">"An English and an American Poet,"</a> <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Phrenological Journal</span>, 90-91. </span></span></p>

    To neutralize the daunting achievements of the British literary heritage, Whitman contended that Britain was tired, on the decline, spent.  In contrast, he claimed that the U.S. was raw, rank, vibrant, young, vital, and full of possibilities. These characteristics would be all the more apparent if American writers ceased being fettered by British models and politics that were all awry: "Of the leading British poets many who began with the rights of man, abj[i?]ured their beginning and came out for king[c]raft priestcraft, obedience, and so forth.—Southey, Coleridge, and Wordsworth, did so."<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n4"><span><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/manuscripts/marginalia/annotations/duk.00169.html">"What are inextricable from the British poets,"</a> in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Archive</span>. </span></span></div>
    
    <p class="tei_p">What remains surprising is Whitman's remarkable confidence in the face of the British poetic tradition. This confidence was not a result of a thorough mastery of their writings but instead of a journalist's rough and ready understanding based on a cursory—but perceptive—analysis. As noted, he gained his understanding of their accomplishments primarily by reading reviews of their writings in any number of periodicals.<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n5 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n5"><span>Whitman also had access to the poetry of various British writers through Ludwig Herrig's anthology <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">British Classical Authors</span> (Brunswick: George Westermann, 1851) and through volumes on some individual writers, including Percy Shelley.  Whitman's copy of Shelley is in the Bryn Mawr College library and, interestingly, shows more interest in Shelley's prose than in his poetry. See Kenneth M. Price, "Whitman's Anthology of English Literature," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Library Notes</span> [Duke University] 50 (1982), 33-34, and Peter Van Egmond, "Bryn Mawr College Library Holdings of Whitman Books," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Review</span> 20 (June 1974), 41-50. The most thorough recent study of Whitman and the British writers is Gary Schmidgall, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Containing Multitudes: Walt Whitman and the British Literary Tradition</span> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014). An earlier study that remains useful is Floyd Stovall, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Foreground of</span> Leaves of Grass (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1974). </span></span>  In his marginalia he displays an aggressive engagement with this material, clarifying how he challenged virtually all of his foreign predecessors. These responses were vital in shaping Whitman's poetics, but so too was his encounter with less lofty material. When a reviewer suggested one should read only difficult writers, Whitman argued with him in the margin: "Still all kinds of light reading, novels, newspapers, gossip etc, serve as manure for the few great productions, and are indispensable or perhaps are premises to something better."<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n6 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n6"><span>"Thoughts on Reading, " <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Whig Review</span> 1 (1845), 485. </span></span></p>

    <div class="tei_p p">For Whitman, the poet's personal identity was a key factor, as is evident in his reaction to Keats's definition of poetic identity. An anonymous review of R. M. Milnes's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Life, Letters, and Literary Remains of John Keats</span> gave Keats's description:
      
      <span class="inline_quote">
        <span class="tei_floatingText">
          
            <p class="tei_p">As to the poetical character itself (I mean the sort of which, if I am anything, I am a member, that sort distinguished from the Wordsworthian or egotistical sublime, which is a thing per se and stands alone), it is not itself—it has no self—it is everything and nothing. It has no character. . . .  It has as much delight in conceiving an Iago as an Imogene. What shocks the virtuous philosopher delights the c[h]ameleon poet. . . .  A poet is the most unpoetical of anything in existence, because he has no identity; he is continually in for and filling some other body. . . .  When I am in a room with people, if I am free from speculating on creations of my own brain, then, not myself goes home to myself; but the identity of every one in the room begins to press upon me, so that I am in a very little time annihilated.</p>
          
        </span>
      </span>
      
      Whitman responded in the margin: "the great poet absorbs the Iden[ti]ty and the expe[rience] of others, and they are definite in him or from him; but he p[resses] them all through the powerful press of himself . . . his own masterly identity."<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n7 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n7"><span>Whitman's annotations are on "R. M. Milnes' Life of Keats," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">North British Review</span>, American Edition, 10 (1848), 41 (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, Duke University). Except for the item on Robert Southey and Robert Burns held at Middlebury College, all annotated clippings discussed here can be found in the Trent Collection. </span></span>  Like Keats, Whitman thinks the poet should so fully sympathize with others that their identities mesh, but unlike Keats, he insists that the poet must nonetheless retain a firm sense of personal self. For Whitman, the poet's own character was always of utmost importance: "Understand that you can have in your writing no qualities which you do not honestly entertain in yourself.—Understand that you cannot keep out of your writing the indication of the evil or shallowness you entertain in yourself . . . .  There is no trick or cunning, no art or recipe, by which you can have in your writing that which you do not possess in yourself."<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n8 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n8"><span>Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</span>, ed. Edward Grier (New York: New York University Press, 1984), 1: 222. </span></span>  This passage may suggest that the issue of sincerity, along with that of identity, informed Whitman's reaction to Keats's letter.</div>

    <p class="tei_p">Whitman refused to follow those English theorists who implied that the present lacked the grandeur of the past. When reading a review of Sir Henry Taylor's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Eve of the Conquest</span>, Whitman marked a discussion of the modern character with various means of highlighting: underscoring, wavy lines, and four pointing hands or manicules. The reviewer argued that "aids and appliances," the "shield of law," social uniformity, the division of labor, industrialism, and the moral and intellectual cross-currents inevitable in a period of diffused knowledge all tended to limit individual robustness and make the great character rarer than in simpler times.  Whitman's hopes for democracy and for himself as a poet made it impossible for him to accept this conclusion. "I will take all these things that produce this condition," he wrote, "and make them produce as great characters as any."<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n9 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n9"><span>"Taylor's Eve of the Conquest," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, American Edition, 89 (1849), 186. </span></span></p>

    <p class="tei_p">To Whitman's way of thinking, many English poets lacked "proud, independent" character because of their dependence on patronage. An article on the "Prelude" provoked this comment: "So it seems Wordsworth made a 'good thing' from the start out of his poetry. legacies,! a fat office! pensions from the crown!" In the top margin of another article, "Recollections of Poets Laureate," Whitman wrote: "Tennyson has a pension of £200 a year, conferred by the Queen, some years since."<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n10 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n10"><span>See "The Prelude," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Whig Review</span>, n. s. 7 (1851), 457 and "Recollections of Poets Laureate. Wordsworth: Tennyson," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Whig Review</span>, n. s. 9 (1852), 523. </span></span>  One comment on this did not suffice: he repeated the information in the side margin. The American poet admired neither the dependent position of his English counterparts nor their reliance on a governing aristocracy. The true poet, he said in the 1855 Preface, should "despise riches."</p>

    <p class="tei_p">His critique of poets on financial grounds shifted when he moved beyond England to consider the national poet of Scotland. Robert Burns gained income as an exciseman rather than through an aristocratic system of patronage, and his interest in the local, the ordinary, even the "lowly" intrigued Whitman. In a paste-on regarding Burns (affixed to an article about Robert Southey) we see Whitman's preoccupation with the poet's life rather than, say, poetic themes or technique.<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n11 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n11"><span>"Robert Southey," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Whig Review</span> (February 1851), 157-68. </span></span>  Whitman revises an unidentified newspaper's moralizing biography to suggest that Burns’s poetry of the common man was the product of someone who did not care about money (or opulence). His fall was due to drink, not stepping above his class position.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p class="tei_p">Like Burns who was "faithful to . . . idioms" of Scotland, Whitman insisted that American writers should "throw off" the restraints of standard English in order to create a language commensurate with the "new occasions, new facts, new politics, new combinations" found in the U.S.<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n12 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n12"><span>Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daybooks and Notebooks</span>, ed. William White (New York: New York University Press, 1978), 3:754. </span></span>  He said: "I love to go away from books, and walk amidst the strong coarse talk of men as they give muscle and bone to every word they speak."<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n13 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n13"><span><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daybooks and Notebooks</span>, 3: 811. </span></span>  Yet this was a pose, since Whitman discovered his methods through his own immersion in print culture, even if that prompted him to negate much of what he encountered. Remarkably, Whitman never seemed to doubt the intrinsic importance of his own way of approaching poetry. He was certain that poetry must reach the people and on (what he thought were) their terms. In fact, certainty was the major enabling factor in these first years of creativity. It allowed Whitman to contradict predecessors, to challenge convention, to stand alone in insistence on a democratic norm. It subsumed every difficulty in the name of assertion, innovation, and provocation.</p>
