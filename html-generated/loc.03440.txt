        Mr. Walt. Whitman,
        Camden, N.J.
            Dear Sir:—
        Some four of five weeks ago I wrote you for your autograph,
        but have as yet received no reply. Will you not kindly
        favor me by early mail? It will be greatly appreciated.
            Yours very truly,
            M. Ida Phares,
        Carlyle's words:
        ......"this poor, diminishing,
        quack world" Another time "this
        poor muddy world."
