        Niembsch Lenau (Nicolaus Ărehlenan)
            Hungarian—living died 1853
            insane an
            idiotic and
            animal
            —from love
            aged 35
        
        Tanko', the horse-herd
        a popular poem
        life of a Hungarian horse‑herd,
        scenes, characteristic adventures,—
        —common life—real life.—
        
        conversation with Mr. Held about German poets
            his talk☟ as follows:
        Frieligrath (frí le grät a democrat—impulsive
        when he meets any one, or as he walks the road,
        or at a meal, &amp;c &amp;c. he composes—he improvises
        easily—
        Rickert, Uhland, Kinkel, Hoffman, Heine, Xavier?
        
        Shakespeare depicts actual life,
        Schiller the ideal
        Goethe mixes both actual and ideal
        
        Niebelungen Lied—scene much in the city of Worms
        and environs—Siegfried
        fifth century much of it
        dialogue, passed on from one
        character to another, flowing out,

        Only experts in antique German can get
        along with the Neibelungen—it is as far different
        from modern German as the Saxon preceding
        Chaucer is from the present English.

        The secret is here: ☟
        Perfections are only understood and
        acknowledged responded to by perfections.—
        This rule runs through all, and
        applies to mediocrity, crime, and all the
        rest; each is understood only by the
        like of itself.—
        
        The Any degree of elevation developement in the
        soul is only responded to by the
        similar degree in other souls.—
        One AOne religion wonders at another— A nation wonders how another
        nation can be what it is —wonders how it
        can like what it likes and dislike
        what it dislikes; one A man
        wonders at another man's religon, folly
        and so on.—But what that a nation
        likes, that is Wh part of that nation; and
        what it dislikes is part of the
        same nation; and also its politics and
        religion whatever they are (are parts of the same
        nation—) and all are the inevitable
        results of those all the days and events
        that have preceded the condition
        of that the nation, just as much
        as the condition of the geology of any that part of the
        [ea?]rth is the [result?]
