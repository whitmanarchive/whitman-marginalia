                Grier argues that Whitman paraphrases Joseph Gostwick's German Literature (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1854). See Walt Whitman: Notebooks and Unpublished Manuscripts, ed. Edward F. Grier (New York: New York University Press, 1984), 5:1816. These two scraps are pasted down, leaving the verso unavailable; Grier says these pages originally were pinned together.

            The celebrated old German poem
                we are going to make a running sketch
                of, is traceable back to the Twelfth
                Century, when, or soon after when, it was probably put in the
                shape transmitted to us modern times, by
                some writer or rhapsodist whose name is  now unknown.—
                Yet it is quite certain that this remarkable
                epic, long antedates even that far off
                period.—How much further back, though,
                it is impossible to tell, with any certainty.
            
            Of the many critical theories, about the construction of the Nibelungen, the
                most plausible is that these were the many
                ballads or versions floating about, were
                collected by the rhapsodist just before alluded
                to, during the Twelfth or Thirteenth Century, and fused into one connected Epic.—
                The critics say they can tell the connecting
                passages; and they point to marked differences
                of style, and contradictions.—run on
                The Nibelungen is thus, by high
                    authorities, stated to be have been a  series of formed from this  ballads
                    belonging to several ages, but having a general
                    principle of union and character, and thus comes to be united
                    upon the thread of one main plot.—
