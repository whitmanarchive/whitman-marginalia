            Presidential Election
            Oct. 31 '84—The political parties
            are trying to—but mostly in vain—to
            get up some ex fervor of excitement
            on the pending Presidential election. It
            comes off next Tuesday. There is
            no question at issue of any importance. I cannot 'enthuse' at all.
            I think of the elections of 30 and 20
            years ago. Then there was something to arouse a fellow. But I like well the fact
            of this all these National Elections—have
            written a little poem about it (to order
            —published in a Philadelphia daily *
            of 26th instant. One of the reporters papers has
            interview'dinterviewed me early in the week, and his
            printed the following yesterday:
            
                
                     
                         
                             
                         A POET ON POLITICS.
                         
                         Walt Whitman May Vote for Blaine, but has
                         a Good Word for the Other Side.
                             "Yes," said old democratic Walt Whitman
                             to a gentleman connected with THE PRESS,
                             seated in the parlor of his little brown wooden
                             house in Camden the other day, "I may vote
                             for Blaine—undoubtedly shall—and yet I am
                             an out and out opponent of the high tariff
                             system, and respect and admire Governor
                             Cleveland personally. They say Blaine is a
                             mighty good fellow. Did you ever meet him
                             much personally? He is a large man, isn't
                             he?"
                             "Rather large; he is above the medium
                             height, broad shouldered, in excellent health,
                             and is a jolly good fellow, physically and
                             mentally."
                             "So my friends tell me, but I never met
                             him."
                             "Don't you think, Mr. Whitman, there
                             was something commendable in Mr. Blaine's
                             South American policy?"
                             "I do, decidedly. The United States, as
                             the biggest and eldest brother, may well come
                             forward and say to the South American
                             states, 'Let us all form a bond of union, not
                             only to increase our prosperity in a commercial
                             point of view, but to resent and resist anything
                             like foreign aggression.' I think no
                             American can object to it. I believe Blaine
                             is going to be elected. He will then come
                             out well, I have no doubt. When a man
                             is made President he soon gets a profound
                             sense of his responsibilities, and an earnest
                             desire to render his country good service. In
                             looking back over the list, I cannot think of
                             a single President who did not do the best he
                         
                     
                
            
                
                
                    
                        
                            
                            
                            knew how from his point of view, although
                            mistakes, and some pretty bad ones, have
                            occurred. Even Fillmore, Buchanan and
                            Andrew Johnson must be given the credit of
                            patriotic intentions, whatever errors they
                            made."
                            Mr. Whitman, in cheeriness and good
                            heart at any rate, is a man who does not
                            seem to age rapidly. A series of paralytic
                            strokes, received in Washington soon after
                            the close of the Secession War, while he was a
                            clerk in the Attorney-General's office under
                            Grant's administration—the result of over
                            two years' exhaustive personal labor in the
                            army hospitals and on the field—destroyed
                            his activity to some extent, but he has recuperated,
                            and now manages, with the aid of
                            a cane, to take an occasional short walk. He
                            still wields the pen in moderation.
                            In appearance and conversation he is much
                            the same as the Walt Whitman of fourteen
                            years ago. He is one of the cluster of writers
                            engaged to furnish the living history of the
                            Secession War, now just begun by General
                            Beauregard in "The Century." Whitman is
                            to write the Army Hospital article. He said
                            to the writer, half in jest, he should write
                            the Indian Summer of his poetry yet, if life
                            and health are spared.

                    Dear Sir:
                
                I write to you to
                ask your assist kind offices in
                the following described matter:
                I se re sent an order to
                Dol to Doolady over six
                weeks ago an order
                Mr. James Gray, Bookbinder
                16 Spruce st. 4th floor, is the
                custodian of the sheets of my
                Leaves of Grass, &amp; has been a
                the binder of them for me.
                There is in— They The sheets are now
                at his place.
                I hear that he has become
                involved—in fact has failed.
                If so, I regret it much.
                I have been waiting f now
                some over six weeks for the ful
                filmentfulfillment of orders I have sent
                on there him for bound books—&amp; now,
                under that state of things, I suppose
                I cannot get the work done by him.
                    it will be impossible not be possible for him to
                do the work.
