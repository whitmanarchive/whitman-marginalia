            Frances Wright
            Madame D'Arusmont
            (talk with Mrs. Rose Feb. 9th, '57
            Frances Wright was born in Scotland, of
            gentle lineage—parents died early—educated by
            uncles,—noblemen; was talented early—of free
            enquiring disposition—republican—wrote
            "A few Days in Athens" when 20 years old—
            —Came to America—lectured—had to do with
            the "Free Enquirer," an atheistical weekly—
            —was a noble, (but much scorned) woman
            —married D'Arusmont—the great error
            of her life—he coveted her property—
            thwarted her—kept exclusive possession
            of her child, a daughter; Frances
            had great wealth (Mrs. Rose says $150,000)
            —D'A. obtained all—even a second
            bequest left to Frances by a Scotch
            aunt—Frances had even to sue
            for a maintenance out of her own
            property.— Judge allowed her $1000 a year
            —Frances died somewhere about 1853—
            a heart‑broken, harassed woman—
            all her philanthropic schemes and
            ideas, coming to nought—(I like much
            her portrait-engraving—where she is
            represented seated—)
