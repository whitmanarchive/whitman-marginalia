                Floyd Stovall recognized this piece as a "paraphrase, with a few quotations, of Macauley's essay on Goldsmith in Encyclopedia Britannica (8th ed.) which Whitman would have read in Harper's Magazine, 14 (April 1857), 633–639.

            Oliver Goldsmith
            born at Pallas, (Ireland)
            Nov. 1728
            father a curate &amp; small farmer
            —moved to WesmeathWestmeath £200 a year
            educated Trinity College, Dublin
            thoughtless, heedless, credulous,
            —gambled, was helped
            to money—lost it—
            
            at 24 went to EdinbughEdinburgh to
            lectures—thence to Leyden—
            —at 27 with a smattering of medical
            knowledge wandered through France,
            Italy, Switzerland—Flanders, Italy
            —returned to England—lived in low 
            life
            from 30 to 36—a literary hack
            —then better known &amp; better off
            —then prosperous received sums
            of £200, £300, £600 &amp;c for his
            poems, histories &amp; plays—
            
            as a talker, frivolous, weak, no good—
            
            as a writer and compiler, wonderfully
            ignorant
            
            
            2
            was a gambler still—got
            deeply in debt £2000—preyed upon
            his mind—
            
            associates regarded him with
            kindness and contempt
            
            he was envious, and showed it—
            
            income last 7 years of his life £400 a
            year
            
            died 3rd April, 1774—in
            his 46th year
            
            he sometimes felt keenly the
            sarcasm which his wild
            blundering talk brought upon
            him.
