            old, and Shakespeare 29—

            the 12th year of his age.
            
            1598 To this year, only five of
            his plays had been printed—although
            he had been a public writer for
            twelve years.—
            (Positively, he was by certain parties,
            more or less numerous, adjudged
            already to deserve a place
            among the great masters, as
            early as this date—16598 in the  35th

            The printing of ShakspearesShakespeares dramas
            was without his instigation
            or assistance—It is thought quite certain he
            was indifferent to their appearance
            in print—and did not mind
                even the blunders and omississionsomissions
                that marred themprobably for the same reason
                that Forrest would not like to
                have his plays in print now
            
            1598—Now, (12 years after going to London,)
            he returns to Straftford, purchases
            and lives in one of the best
            houses of the place—"New Place"
            1601 his father died, aged 71—his last years
            were probably comfortable.

            1600As the first translations (worth‑mentioning) of the Iliad
            and Odyssey were published in 1675, Shakespeare
            was probably not intimate with those poems.—
            
            Queen Elizabeth no doubt often saw
            Shakespeare as an actor, and
            applauded him.

            also have seen

            of course Queen Elizabeth
            reigned.—
            1607 Susanna, his eldest daughter,
            aged 24, was married to
            John Hall, "gentleman"
            —a physician.—
            1608 his mother died—a
            little previous, his brother died.
            —the mother was probably
            over y 70 years of age.
            Shakespeare, at this time, 1608
            wasseems to have had his reputation
            at its height.—
            £400 a year is supposed to have
            now been his income. 1608
            
            Burbage died worth £300 a year.—
            
            about 16037—(15 years after the "Venus
            and Adonis,)
            Lord Southampton still
            befriends Shakespeare—writing
            a letter to the Lord Chamberlain
            in behalf of him and Burbage

            1600 and for some time before and
            after, juvenile companies were
            much patronised—They must
            have been very good companies
            too.—
            Shakespeare owened in both the
            Globe and Blackfriars theatretheater.

            thrifty, borrowed money, loaned

            Richard, his youngest brother,
            died in 1612—aged 40
            His brother Gilbert two years
                his elder, probably resided
                in Stratford in 1612—and
                before &amp; afterward
            His sister Joan, (5 years younger
            than he) married William
            Hart, hatter,—they called their
            first child "William."
            His daughter Susannah made
            him a grandfather when he
            was 45 years old.

            The half‑length upon his monument
            (erected anterior to 1623,) "conveys5 the
            impression of a cheerful, good‑
                natured tempered, somewhat jovial
                man."
            (It is evident to me, beyond cavil,
            that Shakespeare, in his own day,
            ?and at death, was by many placed
            among the great masters, and
            acknowledged.)and yet the florid style
            of praise was applied to
            everybody and almost everything
            in those times.
            "He was a handsome, well‑shaped man,
            very good company, and of a very
            ready, and pleasant, and smooth
            wit." Aubrey.
            Some think Shakespeare was lame,
            —and, for that reason, retired
            from the stage—lame
            perhaps, from some accident.—
            "gentle" is the epithet often
            applied to him.
            ? at that was time was not its signification "like a gentleman"
            "of highblooded
            bearing"?
            Fuller speaks of the "wit combats
            between Shakespeare &amp; Ben Jonson
            at the Mermaid club.

            His autograph is in a translation
            of "Montaigne's essays"—he then
            must have been familiar with Montaigne.—
            
            "Venus &amp; Adonis" passed through six editions,
            in Shakespeare's lifetime, and a
            number more afterwards.
            Sonnets—first printed 1609.
            Milton admired and loved Shakespeare
            —writes praises of him.—
            
                But yet he charges harshly against Charles 1st that the monarch
            had a copy of Shakespeare in his cabinet for his constant
            use.
            
            The character of the bastard Falconbridge,
            —his animal gloating pleasure over the
                fact that hese is the bastard
            of a kindg rather than the
            legitimate son of a knight—
            what was this but either from a sentiment now repudiated or to please
            the aristocracy?—Yet, what was it
            also but a true depicting of those
            days?—a true depicting also of
            thousands of men's minds these days?
            
            Shakespeare is much indebted to the
                ancients—Hamlet's soliloquy, )? is this so?
            "To be or not to be"
            is taken almost verbatim from Plato—
            —To the Iliad, every one of his best plays is
            largely indebted.—

                            ShakspereShakespeare as a Man.—It is a nobler thing
                                to know that such a man as ShakspereShakespeare was created than to
                                be familiar with the shelves of whole libraries of dusty
                                tomes. The advent of a soul so richly gifted, of a nature so
                                intensely ideal and so richly passionate, is an era in the
                                history of man. No poet ever reached a hightheight so lofty,
                                described so  grandly, speculated so daringly, or felt so
                                deeply; and none ever seemed so little conscious of an
                                effect. His grandest thoughts flow so naturally, that it is
                                easy to see that they are familiar and accustomed to his
                                mind; and his gayetygaiety and mirth are equally characteristic
                                of himself. Hamlet and Mercutio, Macbeth and Romeo,
                                Prospero and Benedick, are all ShakspereShakespeare in his different
                                moods; the ver, the wit, the idealist, soldier and sage,
                                each and all bear the impress of having originated from
                                the same mind. There is probably less known of ShakspereShakespeare
                                personally than of any man of mark in English history.
                                He lived in an age of heroes, and he was a foremost man
                                among them. His contemporaries bowed before his
                                master spirit, and the most colossal minds of all Europe
                                have acknowledged his sovereignty. And yet we have a
                                better knowledge of men who died a thousand years ago,
                                before printing perpetuated tradition, when chroniclers
                                were few, than of this wondrous man. There is not, we
                                have reason to think, a single letter of his writing preserved,
                                and scarcely a contemporary anecdote. There
                                are portraits not one of which can be proved to be authentic;
                                a bust which seems genuine, but cannot be warranted.
                                This man, the real spiritual king of England, is in his individuality
                                as much a myth as Homer. But this we do
                                know, a man there lived whose intellectual and moral
                                nature was a microcosm which embraced the ideal of humanity,
                                and that he left behind a hundred representatives
                                of his own mind, none like each other, but all like himself,
                        
                    
                
            
                
                
                    
                        
                            
                            by whom every passing speculation or reasoning is best
                                illustrated, and in whom every emotion finds its noblest
                                and most genuine utterance.
                            
                        
                    
                
            
                
                
                    
                        
                            
                            
                            SHAKSPEARESHAKESPEARE'S STAGE.
                            The ElizebethanElizabethan theatretheater must be viewed as little
                                better than Richardson's shows, as far as appliances
                                go. The curtains pull apart, and there is a tapestry
                                representing a town—that in Troy. To make sure of
                                it, there's a board overhead with the name written upon
                                it, like a finger-post. At the back of the stage is
                                a platform and balcony—that is the city-wall, where
                                Helen will see the armies, of eight men each, pass in
                                awful procession—the Greeks a little knock-kneed, the
                                Trojans two of them squinting. The musicians are in a
                                high stage-box. The actors enter—Troilus in hose and
                                doublet, and Cressida, a plump boy of fourteen, in fardingale
                                and scarf. A man in a black velvet cloak,
                                heralded by a trumpet, has before this entered as Prologue.
                                Such is ShakspeareShakespeare's stage. On the boards at
                                each side are gallant's smoking and laughing. The pit
                                is standing, and the second gallery cracking nuts and
                                pelting Hector with rotten apples. But in the best
                                boxes we see some rather eminent men—Burleigh, for
                                instance, and Sidney and Raleigh, while ShakspeareShakespeare acts

            Shakespeare put such things into
            his plays as would please the
            family pride of kings and queens and of his patrons among the nobility.—
            He did this for the Queen Elizabeth,
            and for James the 1st.— His renderings of many phases of character—The rabble,
            Jack Cade, the French Joan, the
            greasy and stupid canaille that
            Coriolanus cannot stomach, all these
                are marked, in his renderings of them, with
                the as he renders them, take mean
                and please feed fed the aristocratic vanity —
            of the young noblemen and gentlemen and feed them in England yet.—
            —Family Common blood is but wash—the
            hero is always of high lineage.—
            
            Doubtless in so rendering humanity,
            Shakespeare strictly rendered what was to him the truth.
            —and what was the truth.— The class of mechanics, tailors,
            salesmen, attendants, &amp;c, in Europe
            then, perhaps even now, are they
             or are they not properly reflected by such reflections
            as Shakespeare gives of them?—

            a paper read by William Henry
            Smith, author of "Was Lord Bacon
            the author of Shakespeare's Plays?"
            —"What Pope says of some of the Plays
            of Shakespeare is probably of true of
            all—that they were pieces of unknown
            authors, or fitted up for the theatretheater
            while under his administration,—revised
            and added to by him."
            It seems according to Malone
            that "the London Prodigal" was
            acted at his theatretheater and afterwards
            printed with his Shakespeare's name on the
            title page—and, though he had
            never written a line of it he
            was indifferent to the cheat
            and to the printer's impudence.
            —Bacon, according to W.H. Smith,
            was most probably the real author
            —he goes on with his reasons
            therefortherefore, some of them very curious
            and plausible, especially a contemporary
            letter to Viscount St Albans calling Bacon saying "the most
            prodigious wit that ever I knew of
                any my nation, or thi of this side of the sea,
            was of your Lordship's name, though he
            be known by another."
            Jan '57—Smith continued these lectures
            
            Overcoloring.
            Many little things are too much
            overcolored, in Shakespeare—far too
            much.— The features of beloved women, compliments,
             the descriptions of moderately brave actions, professions of service and
            hundreds more, are painted too intensely.
            It is no answer to this, to say that
            a lover would so state the case
            about a woman he loved, or that
            a strong rich nature would be
            apt to describe incidents in that
            manner; and that therefore Shakespeare
            is therefore correct in so presenting them.—
            Immensely too much is unnaturally
            colored—the sentiment is piled
            on, similes, comparaisons, defiances,
            exaltations, divinities, immortalities,
                are all bestowed upon themes certainly not
            worthy the same,——thus losing proportion.— (Also, ?? many most
            of the discursive speeches of the
            great and little characters are
            glaringly inappropriate, both words
            and sentiments such as could not
            have come from their mouths, in real life  and
            therefore should not in the plays.—).— Yet on great
            occasion the character and action are
            perfect.— This is what saves Shakespeare
            —Is he imitative of Homer? If so, where and how?
