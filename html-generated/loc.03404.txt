        "Church" Article.
        
            
            The Dutch Reformed Church
            was ecclesiasticaly dependent
            upon the Presbytery of
            Amsterdam, Holland, and
            kept up its connection
            with its home superiors
            there, down to the time of
            the American Revolution
        
                
        
        "Churches)
        In 1690 As early as 1695, Independent
        churches were common on 
        Long Island, acknowledging
        no Presbytery or Episcopate,
        but voluntaryily coming together,
        and supporting what minister
        suited them.— But
        tThe Dutch Reformed and 
        the English Episcopal
        were the main sects—
        but in on New York island
        there were churches of
        French Protestants, and many 
        other orders, including a
        Jews' Synagogue.— Every 
        faith indeed was represented here.
        
        
        
        "Religion"
        
            There was all the feeling of toleration.
            When Cornbury, a zealous
            Episcopal, caused two
            Presbyterian colporteurs
            to be brought to trial
            (1707) for prosecuting their 
            missionary labors without 
            license, the people 
            were indignant, and 
            the jury soon acquitted them.
            
            For a time in some of the English colon there
            was quite a persecution
            of the Quakers, but
            it never practically amounted to
            any thing in Brooklyn,
            or on Manhattan
            Island.— The soil and air of These places,
            at least, remain, 
            from the first beginning, without
            any of the stain of the 
            blood or the echos of the strikes,
            of a single religious punishments.—
            
        
        
        For a long while
        after the Reformation
        the Catholic Powers Princes of Europe,
        and under them many numbers of
        devoted enthusiasts, cheris
        strove by fair and
        foul means to
        extirpate the heresy,
        and bring back power
        to the Pope and the
        old faith.— The ensan
        sanguinary wars and massacres,
        —the furious feelings and
        an mental contests,—of 
        these attempts,—were
        always reflected in the
        Colonies especially in 
        New England and New York.—
