        Of all the western stars until I die.
        It may be that the gulfs will wash us down,
        It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles
        And see the great Achilles whom we knew.
        Though much is taken, much abides; and though
        We are not now that strength which in old days,
        Moved earth &amp; heaven—that which we are, we are,
        One equal temper of heroic hearts,
        Made weak by time &amp; fate, but strong in will
        To strive, to seek, to find, &amp; not to yield.
        
         
           
        Dear Sir or Madam:
        You are invited to attend a meeting on Tuesday 
        Evening, December 15th, 1885, to be held at the residence of
        Mr. Courtlandt Palmer, 117 East 21st Street, Gramercy Park,
        in behalf of Manual Training, especially as it is illustrated in the
        methods pursued in the Gramercy Park School and Tool-house,
        No. 104 East 20th Street.
        This enterprise in education, of which Mr. Andrew D. 
            White, Ex-President of Cornell University wrote: "I have long 
            believed that such schools are among the greatest necessities of
            our country," has now become a systematically arranged institu-
            tion, but (as is generally the case with all new departures),
            it has yet been insufficiently appreciated, and it is with the
            hope of enlarging its sphere of influence and usefulness that you
            are asked to assist, on the occasion referred to, with your presence
            and advice.
        Short addresses may be expected from Gen. Alexander
        S. Webb, President of the Free College of the City of New York,
        and from Mr. Andrew Carnegie, Rev. Wm. Lloyd, Rabbi G.
        Gotthell and Mr. F. B. Thurber. A letter from Rev. R.
        Heber Newton, favoring the project, will be read.
         New York, December 8th, 1885.
