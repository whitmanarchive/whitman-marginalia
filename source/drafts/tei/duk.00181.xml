                                            <p>M&#230;cenas, the most  
                                            egregious of classic exquisites, is said to have  
                                            "wielded the Roman Empire with rings on his  
                                            fingers." The vanity of Benvenuto Cellini is too  
                                            well known to need repetition. Sir Walter Raleigh  
                                            was, perhaps, the greatest beauty on record. His  
                                            shoes, on court-days, were so gorgeouslly adorned  
                                            with precious stones as to have exceeded six thousand
                                            guineas in value; and he had a suit of armor
                                            of sold silver, with jewels, sword and  
                                            belt, the worth of which was almost incalculable.
                                            The great Descartes was very particular  
                                            about his wig and always kept four in his dressing  
                                            closet; a piece of vanity wherein he was imitated  
                                            by Sir Richard Steele, who never expended less  
                                            than forty guineas upon one of his large black  
                                            periwigs. Mozart, whose light hair was of fine  
                                            quality, wore it very long and flowing down  
                                            between his shoulders, with a tie of coloured ribbon
                                            confining it at the neck. Poet Goldsmith's  
                                            innocent dandyism, and the story of his peach- 
                                            blossom coat are almost proverbial. Pope's self- 
                                            love was so great that, according to Johnson, he  
                                            "had been flattered till <hi rend="underline" hand="#h1">he thought himself one of 
                                            the moving powers in the system of life."</hi></p>
                                            <p>Allan Ramsay's egotism was excessive. On  
                                                one occasion he modestly took precedence of  
                                                Peter the Great in estimating their comparative   
                                                importance with the public: "but haud [hold],   
                                                proud, czar," he says, "I wadna niffer [exchange]   
                                                fame!" Napoleon was vain of his small foot. Salvator
                                                Rosa was once heard to compare himself  
                                                with Raphael and Michael Angelo, calling the  
                                                former dry and the latter coarse; and Raphael  
                                                again was jealous of the fame and skill of Michael  
                                                Angelo. Hogarth's historical paintings&#8212;which  
                                                were bad&#8212;equalled, in his own opinion, those of  
                                                the old masters. Sir Peter Lely's vanity was so  
                                                well known, that a mischievous wit resolved to  
                                                try what amount of flattery he would believe, <hi rend="underline" hand="#h1">told

                                                which the painter emphatically replied; "Fore  
                                                Gott, sare, I believe you're right!" Bojarda, the  
                                                Italian poet, ascribed so high an importance to  
                                                his poetry, that when he had invented a suitable  
                                                name for one of his heroes, he set the bells ringing  
                                                in the village. Kotzebue was so vain and envious
                                                that he could endure nothing celebrated to  
                                                be near him, though it were but a picture or a  
                                                statue; and even Lamartine, the lofties and  
                                                finest of French poets, robs his charming pages  
                                                of half their beauty by <hi rend="underline" hand="#h1">the inordinate self-praise

                                                "the self-torturing egotist:" and Lord Byron's  
                                                life was one long piece of egotism from beginning  
                                                to end. He was vain of his genius, his rank, his  
                                                misanthropy, and even of his vices; and he was  
                                                particularly proud of his good riding and his

                            the present. And we will add, that we

                            that we remember the wear of life  
                            with which its foundations were laid, the  
                            blood with which its stones were cemented,
                            and the skill and toil and labor  
                            of scheming, with which its arches

                                Shelley's poetical works have attained,  
                                is such as at once compels us soberly to  
                                consider their merits, and relieves us from  
                                the less responsible task of echoing the  
                                notes of an established fame. However  
                                great in reality this poet may be, many  
                                years must yet pass before he can become
                                a subject of reverential criticism;  
                                before he can take rank, if it be his destiny
                                to do so, with those great immortals  
                                whose claims it is impiety to question.  
                                The voice of general reputation has only  
                                presented the world with the name of  
                                another candidate for this high honor,  
                                whom the ages must accept or refuse.</p>
                                <p>It was at the memorable period,  
                                    when all Europe resounded with the  
                                    crash of the fallen Bastile, that our poet
                                    first breathed the air of mortality.  
                                    The same lofty and enthusiastic hope,  
                                    the same restless excitement, which were  
                                    everywhere kindling with the events of  
                                    those remarkable days, characterized the  
                                    youth and the man. He lived, labored,  
                                    and died, as if a nursling of that turbulent
                                    spirit which then sprung forth armed  
                                    from the fevered brain of France. The  
                                    whole course of his existence was tumultuous
                                    with rebellion, and dark with  
                                    discontent; and his melancholy end seems  
                                    but an index of the entire history. Shelley's

                                    amiable, and heroic character; ardent in  
                                    the pursuit of ideal perfection, reckless   
                                    of the precepts of custom, and hostile  
                                    to an order of things necessarily imperfect;
                                    but always excellent and sincere in   
                                    his intentions for himself and for the  
                                    world. This judgment commends him to  
                                    our charity, surely&#8212;since he has gone to   
                                    his last sleep&#8212;and it hides a "multitude

                                    <p>The fiery youth had, he confesses, "a  
                                        passion for reforming the world." In  
                                        this by no means original character, as he  
                                        professes to aim solely at the public good,  
                                        so he must, at all times, submit to be estimated
                                        according to the public wisdom.  
                                        In his practical tendencies, Shelley was  
                                        merely an agitator, without aim and without
                                        wisdom. Certain <hi rend="italic">words</hi> rankled in  
                                        his mind, and kept him in a perpetual  
                                        restless fever; but to attach a meaning  
                                        to these words, or an object to the impulses
                                        they excited, never came at all  
                                        within the scope of his intent. There is  
                                        much reason to suppose that the old  
                                        law of obedience to father and mother,  
                                        during the years of minority, is still a  
                                        very valuable regulation. But even if it  
                                        happened that the youth of nineteen was  
                                        really endowed with wisdom so superior  
                                        &#8212;with so clear a vision of justice and of  
                                        truth&#8212;why did he take such pains to  
                                        render it of no effect? Grant that the

                    world is wrong, why fall into a frenzy, because the multitude are bent on deceiving themselves and each other? 
                    There are those, we know, to whom this raving discontent looks like a sign 
                    of millennial days&#8212;a spontaneous prophecy of the future greatness of humanity
                    &#8212;but to us, we confess, it looks like 
                    downright madness. Shelley could not 
                    obey his own laws. Raging against the 
                    institution of marriage, he is twice married; his declamations on vegetable diet 
                    and cold water, are discovered to have had 
                    their origin in stronger excitants. Insane agitators forget the vastness of the 
                    gulf between the conception and the execution; and the men of universal benevolence and self-sacrifice, seldom stay 
                    to test their principles on themselves, 
                    until they are too far committed for a 
                    public renunciation.</p>

                        The poet retires upon himself, viewing the world as a

                        is the poet's peculiar province, to dwell 
                        among those ideal forms, of which all 
                        things are imperfect copies; to paint an 
                        imaginary perfection, the contemplation 
                        of which shall give a newer life, and a 
                        better development, to all that man creates and controls. Had Shelley confined 
                        himself to this ideal sphere, he might 
                        have done better for himself and for humanity.</p><anchor xml:id="s6"/>

                            very useless to conjecture. He must remain, 
                            to our sight, like the broken shaft 
                            of a monumental column, for whose

                            are wanting, and beyond the point 
                            of whose fracture the sculptor cares not 
                            to extend his conception. </p>

                                        bad, to sink his personality in human 
                                        sympathy; he becomes, by necessity, a 
                                        desperate egotist. Shelley would, perhaps, 
                                        have loved his neighbors well 
                                        enough, could he have made them what 
                                        he desired they should be. His chief 
                                        poems are founded on his own personal 
                                        experience. The hero and heroine of his 
                                        longest work, (originally entitled "Laon 
                                        and Cythna,") are recognized from first 
                                        to last&#8212;and they are represented, it 
                                        would seem, with a literal fidelity even 
                                        superior to that which distinguishes the 
                                        Harold of Lord Byron. The subject is 
                                        none other than the celebration of rebellion against all wholesome restraint from 
                                        without, and of the most perfect submission to the tyranny of every passionate 
                                        and hostile impulse within.</p>

                                            from the clouds to the sea, and from the

                                            not a little to admire; and, had the first

                    and united with a better grace, 
                    the work might be accounted a noble 
                    production. </p>
                    <p>It is for the "Cenci" that the admirers of 
                        Shelley usually claim the greatest merit. 
                        Here, if anywhere, egotism will certainly 
                        be sought in vain, as totally incompatible 
                        with the drama and unpardonable therein. This work is indeed unusually free 
                        from his worst peculiarities; yet we 
                        might have predicted for the author that 
                        he could not write it without seeking an 
                        opportunity of venting his spleen, 
                        through the mouth of Count Cenci. 
                        Where this can be successfully accomplished, the interest never flags, and the 
                        poet sometimes becomes scarcely less 
                        than great. That this tragedy, however, 
                        is destined to a high rank in its kind, 
                        may be very safely disputed. The final 
                        impression seems to us unalleviated horror, and not the subdued sorrow of genuine tragedy. </p> 
                        <p>"Prometheus Unbound" deserves a 
                            higher praise; yet it needs a mind of a 
                            peculiar and not a frequent order to enter 
                            into its spirit as a whole; and here, 
                            again, the author's self appears altogether 
                            too plainly. Few will be persuaded that 
                            the conversations of his voices and 
                            echoes; of his spirits and phantasms; his 
                            fauns and furies, are not often considerably tedious. Nevertheless, a profusion 
                            of intellectual beauties is scattered over 
                            all, and the character of Prometheus 
                            sustains itself in sullen magnificence. </p> 
                            <p>"Adonais" has all the characteristic 
                                beauties and defects of this author, and 
                                the former in their highest perfection. 
                                Like the rest, however, it is deficient in

                                promised pot of gold. His blank verse 
                                is best; for rhyme invariably leads him 
                                into wanderings and mazes, from which 
                                his final escape becomes a miracle. This 
                                is especially noticeable in the arbitrary 
                                forms of rhyme and verse, such as the 
                                Spenserian stanza, in which his longest 
                                work is written, and in the <hi rend="italic">Terza Rime</hi>,

                                    Shelley's claims must fall. We find no 
                                    genuine traces of this gift in any of his 
                                    verse or prose. Sometimes there is a 
                                    near approach to the humorous&#8212;an approach and nothing more. He can 
                                    adopt an easy, cheerful style, and frequently sustains himself gracefully there-

                                    some primary defect, that vitiates the 
                                    whole writing. Shelley never enters into the <hi rend="italic">sober sadness</hi> of human life&#8212;into 
                                    the <hi rend="italic">reality</hi> of all that real persons do and 
                                    feel. He lacks that practical faith which 
                                    gives a solid consistence to the dramas 
                                    of Shakspeare, and the want of which 
                                    leaves all poetry barren and aimless.</p>
                                    <p>Most of his figures are so very subtle 
                                        as to appear at the first view unintelligible; and though their fine meaning 
                                        may come in time to be recognized, it is 
                                        vexatious to be delayed so long in the 
                                        midst of an exciting action. Everything 
                                        is overdone. We sicken on a profusion 
                                        of sweets. <span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h2" xml:id="s19" from="#s19" to="#s20"/><hi rend="underline" hand="#h2">We are wearied and bewildered

                                            again, with a tiresome pertinacity. It is 
                                            only among his minor poems that we can 
                                            sometimes find an exception, which gives
