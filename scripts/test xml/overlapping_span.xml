            <p><hi rend="underline" resp="#h2">If genius would attain its uttermost longevity,
            another condition it must submit to
            is, that of despising an <hi rend="italic">ad captandum</hi> compliance<anchor xml:id="s54"/>
            with transient tastes, and the affectation
            of peculiarities for the purpose and
            in the hope of forming, as it were, a school.
            It is not to be denied that literary fashions,
            like others, may be extensive and prevalent
            for a time—but they expire with the age.
            Great genius for awhile will consecrate
            almost any eccentricities, and even acquire
            for them great temporary popularity. <span rend="singleLine-right" resp="#h2" xml:id="s55" from="#s55" to="#s56"/>But
            it may well be questioned whether, where
            there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> great genius and where it has
            succeeded by such artifices, it might not,
            <span rend="bracket-left" resp="#h3" xml:id="s57" from="#s57" to="#s58"/><hi rend="underline" hand="#h3">even among its contemporaries, have gained
            equal applause at a less cost than that of
            <span rend="bracket-left" resp="#h3" xml:id="s59" from="#s59" to="#s60"/>simplicity and nature</hi> But, at all events,<anchor xml:id="s60"/>
            let the writer who attempts to attain fame<anchor xml:id="s58"/>
            by any such fantastic methods, recollect
            how ridiculous a reigning fashion looks a
            century afterwards; for not less ridiculous
            will then appear every thing that bears the
            mark of affectation and mannerism, however
            successful for a time. The Euphuism of
            Elizabeth's day is now viewed only with
            contemptuous wonder: and even Dr. Johnson,
            though he still retains a large measure
            of popularity, would have retained far more
            had it not been for his antitheses and his
            Latinisms.</hi><anchor xml:id="s56"/> Addison, though nearly a century
            earlier, is still more admired, and
            without any deductions.</p>
          
           
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            <span rend="bracket-left" resp="#h2" xml:id="s63" from="#s63" to="#s64"/><p>How singular has been the destiny of
            Aristotle! After having been lost to the
            world for ages, we see him making a second
            and wider conquest, and founding the most
            <note type="authorial" resp="#h2" place="left">Aris‑<lb/>
            totle</note>durable and absolute despotism of mind the
            world has ever seen! After a second dethronement,
            he is now fighting his way back
            to no mean empire,—an empire promising
            to be all the more permanent, that it is
            founded in a juster estimate of his real
            claims on the gratitude and reverence of
            mankind, and that he is invited to wield the
            sceptre, not of a despot, but of a constitutional
            monarch.</p><anchor xml:id="s64"/>

            honest writer, even though but moderately
            successful, and much more if long and
            widely popular, is surely glorious and enviable.
            It may be true that he is to die,—for
            we do not count the record of a name when
            the works are no longer read as anything
            better than an epitaph, and even that may
            vanish; yet, to come into contact with other
            minds, even though for limited periods,—to
            move them by a silent influence—to cooperate
            in the construction of character—to
            mould their habits of thought—to promote
            the dominion of truth and virtue—to exercise
            a spell over those we have never seen
            and never can see,—in other climes,—at
            the extremity of the globe,—and when the
            hand that wrote is still for ever,—is surely a
            most wonderful and even awful prerogative.
            It comes nearer to the idea of the immediate
            influence of spirit on spirit than anything
            else which this world presents us. It<anchor xml:id="s68"/>
            is of a purely moral nature; it is also silent
            as the dew—invisible as the wind!<anchor xml:id="s66"/> We
            can adequately conceive of such an influence
            only by imagining ourselves.</p>
           
            
            <span rend="bracket-left" resp="#h2" xml:id="s69" from="#s69" to="#s70"/><p>Plato, in a well-known passage of his
            Phædrus, describes Socrates as contending
            for the superiority of oral instruction, by representing
            books as <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>. The inferiority
            of the written word to the living voice is in
            many respects undeniable; but surely it is
            more than compensated by the advantage of
            its diffusive and permanent character. <hi rend="underline" resp="#h2">Great
            as has been the influence of Socrates, he
            owes it almost entirely to the books he refused

            greater still, had he condescended to write
            some of his own.</hi><anchor xml:id="s70"/></p>
