                    <p>approaching the communion of modern unbelievers, but by the most unfair
                        means, are endeavouring to press into their company, many honourable
                        christian Quakers, who have long since fallen asleep in Jesus; and who in
                        life, and in death, declared that they had no fellowship with such
                        unfruitful works of darkness.</p>
                    <p> It is not, however, surprising that those who have thus swerved from the
                        ancient faith of the gospel, as held forth by this society, are anxious to
                        gloss over their pernicious principles, and to plume themselves with the
                        credit of antiquity and the authority of " primitive friends." There is
                        something so forbiddingâ€“so unpromising, so utterly comfortless and
                        unamiable, in the principles and character of an unbeliever, that few have
                        been found, who were bold enough to throw off the % mask, and voluntarily to
                        embrace it. They have generally sought to soften down the term, and to give
                        their doctrines a more inviting aspect, by pretending that they differed not
                        in essentials from sound christians; that they only stripped Christianity of
                        human trappings, and taught it "in its native excellence and purity," and
                        that many pious men were of their way of thinking. But the veil is too thin
                        to conceal the deformity which lies beneath. Infidelity, in its most
                        specious forms, has been too often detected, and too fully exposed, to give
                        them any hope of success, and the time is at hand, when they will be made
                        fully manifest.</p>
                    <p>The society of Friends, holds the same relation to other christian
                        professors, that ever it did. William Penn, in his "Testimony to the truth
                        as held by the people called Quakers,"written in 1698, says, " Because we
                        are separated from the publick communion and worship, it is too generally
                        concluded, that we deny the doctrines received by the church, and
                        consequently introduce a new religion; whereas we differ least; where we are
                        thought to differ most. For, setting aside some school terms, <hi rend="italic">we hold the substance of those doctrines, believed by the
                            Church of England, as to God, Christ, Spirit, Scripture, repentance,
                            sanctification, remission of sin, holy living and the resurrection of
                            the just and unjust to eternal rewards and punishments.</hi>

                    <p>It is the certain effect of a faithful submission to the leadings of the Holy
                        Spirit of Christ, to bring its followers into an humble and sincere belief
                        in the sublime doctrines of the christian religion; and as occasion
                        requires, to qualify them earnestly to contend for that precious faith once
                        delivered to the saints, against those who are labouring to destroy it.
                        Hence, it is not surprising,</p>

                        REMARKS.</hi></head>
                    <p>It is no new thing for the writings of the early Quakers to be mutilated and
                        perverted, in order to prove their denial of the doctrines of our Lord Jesus
                        Christ and his apostles. Among the many accusations and calumnies which were
                        heaped upon this despised people, there was none more frequently reiterated,
                        nor more fully refuted and denied, than this, which the compilers of the
                        pamphlet are now endeavouring to support; and it is a fart, that,in order to
                        sustain it, the enemies of the society have <hi rend="italic">always</hi>
                        been compelled to resort to garbling or misrepresentation of their
                        language.</p>
                    <p>It is well known that the fundamental principle of the Society, is a belief
                        in, and an obedience to, the sensible influences of the holy spirit of 
                        Christ, in the soul. At the time of its first rise, this important doctrine
                        was too little known or believed in, while great dependence was placed upon
                        the observation of mere outward rites, and a bare historical belief in the
                        life, suffering, and death of Christ; the scriptures being considered as the
                        word of God, and the alone treasury of that knowledge which gives life
                        eternal. <note type="authorial" resp="#h1" place="inline">[</note>Hence it
                        was, that the Society of Friends, strenuously enforced the <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> of coming to the real experience of the work of
                        regeneration in the heart; to feel Christ ruling there by his spirit; that
                        so the blessed and most comfortable truths of Holy Scripture might be sealed
                        in, their experience, be the revelation of that power which gave the
                        scriptures forth. Now, because Friends preached the necessity of coming to
                        know <hi rend="italic">Christ within</hi>, they were charged with denying 
                            <hi rend="italic">Christ without</hi>, and with believing in Christ no
                        otherwise than as the <note type="authorial" resp="#h1" place="left">â€”</note>spirit in man. And because they taught the necessity of
                        the new birth in the soul, and a real change of heart, whereby all things
                        came to be of God, they were accused of slighting, or wholly denying, the
                        virtue of all that the Son of God had done for them, <hi rend="italic">without them</hi>.</p>
                    <p>These several accusations they again and again refuted; declaring that while
                        they enforced the necessity of the inward work, they were so far from <hi rend="italic">denying the outward</hi>, that they were taught by the
                        Holy Spirit, <hi rend="italic">most reverently and gratefully to believe,
                            and acknowledge all that was done by Jesus Christ without them</hi> ;
                        and that although, with the apostle, they believed the spirit of Christ was
                        in all men, who were not reprobates, yet, so far from doubting, they were
                        taught by this very spirit, unfeignedly to believe and own, both the Godhead
                        and manhood of Jesus Christ, "his miraculous conception, holy life,
                        miracles, propitiatory sacrifice, death, resurrection, ascension, mediation
                        and intercession; and openly to avow their full faith in all that was
                        contained in the Holy Scriptures of truth.</p>
                    <p>So repeatedly has the Society declared its belief, in all these doctrines of
                        the Christian religion, that the generality of liberal minded men have been
                        convinced of the soundness of its faith, and of its</p>

                                regard to the <hi rend="italic">mode of redemption, generally held

                                    Jesus Christ</hi> upon the outward wooden cross. <hi rend="italic">This</hi>, as it regards the redemption of the

                                        <note type="authorial" resp="#h1" place="left">â€”</note>a vulgar error</hi>, that came in with the
                                apostacy from primitive christianity. The redemption effected by <hi rend="italic">this outward offering</hi>, would <hi rend="smallcaps">ONLY</hi>, according to the true analogy of
                                things, be a <hi rend="italic">redemption</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">outward bodies</hi>; for, as under the legal
                                dispensation, there were many legal institutes, that were binding
                                upon the people of Israel, and on no other people, and a breach of
                                these, produced <hi rend="italic">legal crimes</hi> to which
                                penalties were attached, and these inflicted on the <hi rend="italic">bodies of the Israelites</hi>; now I consider that
                                the offering of the body of Jesus Christ on the outward cross
                                applied only as <hi rend="italic">a matter of redemption to the
                                    Israelites</hi>; redeeming them from the curse of that covenant
                                and the penalties attendant on every breach thereof, and this
                                outward redemption was the top stone of that figurative
                                dispensation, as by it that dispensation with all its legal rites

                        could be atoned for by an outward sacrifice; and this last outward sacrifice

                        the Lord Jesus Christ, says :</p>  
                    <p>"Finding this to be the case, <hi rend="italic">I examined the accounts given
                            on this subject, by the four Evangelists, and according to my best
                            judgment on the occasion, 1 was led to think there was considerable more
                            scripture evidence for his being the son of Joseph than otherwise</hi>;
                        although it has not yet changed my belief, are the consequences which follow
                        much more favourable; for as the Israelitish covenant rested very much upon
                        external evidence by way of outward miracle, <hi rend="italic">so I conceive
                            this miraculous birth was intended principally to induce the Israelites
                            to believe he was their promised Messiah, or the great prophet, Moses
                            had long before prophesied of, that should come, like unto
                        himself.</hi></p>

                        led to consider him the son of Joseph, and this it appears very clear they
                        did, by the scripture testimony: and although it has not, as above
                        observed, given cause as yet, to alter my views on the subject, as tradition
                        is a mighty bulwark, not easily removed, yet it has had this salutary
                        effect, to deliver me from judging my brethren and fellow creatures who are

                            should change their belief, unless 1 could give them much greater
                            evidence than 1 am at present possessed of, as 1 consider in regard to
                            our salvation, they are both non-essentials; and I may further say,

                        The animal part is taken, and created flesh, by the power of God."</p>
                    <p>In the same sermon, speaking of " the life which was the light of men," he
                        says, "Here now are we all to have a portion of the same light, for the
                        life was the light of men, and it remains eternally so. It all comes from
                        God, and is dispensed to the children of men, and <hi rend="italic">it was

                        suffering death. He was tempted in all points, as we are. Now, how could he
                        be tempted, <hi rend="italic">if he</hi> had been fixed <hi rend="italic">in
                            a state of perfection in which he could not turn aside</hi>? <anchor xml:id="b018"/>Can you suppose, as rational beings, that such a being
                        could be tempted? No, not any more than God Almighty could be tempted. <hi rend="italic">Perfection is perfection,<note type="authorial" resp="#h1" place="right">â€”</note> and cannot be tempted</hi>. It is
                        impossible: and here it is proved to a demonstration, that <hi rend="italic">he came to be an example</hi> to the children of men; a great high
                        priest and teacher in those things which concern the salvation of the
                        children of men. And here he did his office, as a great high priest of <hi rend="italic">the Jewish covenant, in that outward</hi> dispensation, in
                        which he was limited to the Jewish people as a child of Abraham; to sum up
                        all the righteousness of the law; by faithfulness to it: and when he had
                        effected that part, <hi rend="italic">by the grace of God</hi> that was upon
                        him, for we read that he grew in stature and in favour with God and man ;
                        and the grace of God was upon him.' Then <hi rend="italic">it was not</hi>

                        to the law and commandments given them. It will not do for us to suppose,
                        for a moment, that the Almighty, when he gave this law, did not at the same
                        time give them power to fulfil it in all its parts. For if he did not, they
                        could not be accountable for a neglect. But we see that he did this, for
                        here was a child of Abraham, <hi rend="italic">endued with his spirit, which
                            he has given <note type="authorial" resp="#h1" place="left">â€”</note>to every rational creature</hi> to profit with. He
                        lived up to the law and covenant given by the Father, and in this he
                        justified his heavenly Father in giving this law and covenant, and thereby
                        condemned the Israelites for not fulfilling it. Well, when he had done this,
                        for we hear of <hi rend="italic">no miracles till after all this was
                            done</hi>, none at all; nor any thing of <hi rend="italic">his
                            righteousness or acts</hi>; but now, when he went into the last
                        institute of the legal dispensation, which was called watery baptism, and
                        the ministry of John, his forerunner, was nearly at an end, divine wisdom
                        thought fit to reveal to John, by what medium he should know who it was that
                        was to baptize with the Holy Ghost. It was him on whom the spirit should be
                        seen descending and resting upon him.</p>
                    <p>"Now, we find, that when he came up out of the water, John having baptized
                        him, the Holy Ghost descended in bodily shape like a dove, and rested upon
                        him. Now, whether this was open to John's <pb xml:id="leaf006v" facs="loc_nhg.00335.jpg" type="verso"/>

                        might not rather be an expression of John's, that as the dove is the most
                        innocent creature of the feathered race, he made use of it, to express what
                        he beheld in him, and in this power that descended upon him. <note type="authorial" resp="#h1" place="inline">[</note><span xml:id="s021" from="s021" to="s022" hand="#h1"/>This was a

                    <p>"I consider, according to the tenor of the law, that the whole design was to

                        of the law; and then that it should be abolished. Hence, the fulfilment of
                        the law was the abolishment of the law. He abolished it by nailing it to his
                        cross. <note type="authorial" resp="#h1" place="inline">[</note>Oh! had the

                        be a gospel minister; so likewise, according to his own testimony, nothing
                        ever did or can qualify for the ministry, but the descending of the Holy
                        Ghost from heaven, upon rational creatures. And, therefore, in the same

                        "Now, let us pause a little, and consider what is here meant. Can it be
                        supposed that he was driven into an <hi rend="italic">outward</hi>
                        wilderness? Or shall we not suppose, that he was brought, by the power of
                        divine light, <hi rend="italic">to see the wilderness state in his own
                            mind</hi>? Because, in the outward wilderness a man loses his way, and
                        meets with many trials; and so there is a spiritual wilderness, where man is
                        tempted and tried. Here the natural propensities which are fixed in man, no
                        doubt for an excellent purpose, rise up and attempt to gain an ascendency
                        over us. Here we find it in all things in us. The propensity to
                        thirst&#8211;what does it do? It is a gift of God to the children of men. It
                        leads them to do that which might sustain their natural life. But if not
                        regulated and kept under subjection by the immortal soul, which is placed in
                        us to regulate these animal desires and propensities, it will become
                        injurious to us, by being indulged to excess. For you know we have many
                        propensities; many that are necessary to us: for we could not eat or drink,
                        or have a desire to do if, if we had not a propensity to it. We could not
                        fulfil the command, to increase and multiply, and replenish the earth, had
                        we not a desire which led to it. These propensities are all good in their
                        place; and we could not answer the end of our creation without them. As it
                        is not in bones to think, or flesh to reason, so there is no bounds to our
                        natural desires: but the soul must wait for counsel from on high, and direct
                        the body, and by faithfulness to it, regulate all these desires, and keep
                        them within the bounds of reason and truth. This was the case with the
                        blessed Jesus, so that he never offended in any one point; but learnt
                        obedience by the things he suffered. <hi rend="italic">He had all these
                            desires. The desire after knowledge, and the things of the world,

                        comfortably unto her.' I will allure her&#8211;see, I will draw her. Now
                        what wilderness was this? It was not an outward wilderness; but the same
                        which Jesus was led up into: and here it was that he was tried. Here the
                        tempter <hi rend="italic">led him up to aspire after the glory of the
                            world</hi>. He told him if he would fall down and worship him, that he

                        down and worship it, all should be his: but you see how ready he was to
                        reply to this temptation. The divine law always gives us an answer, and if

                        temptations have arisen, 'Get thee behind me, satan.' Oh! I have seen that
                        it was mine enemy; the light of truth has revealed it to me; and I have felt
                        sometimes, in a degree, like the blessed Jesus. I have seen that mine enemy
                        hath wanted to exalt me: but I could ask no honour or power, for I knew that
                        he had none to give, nor any power to preserve me one moment.</p>
                    <p>"'Get thee behind me, satan: for it is written, thou shalt worship the Lord
                        thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.' Is not this the case with all of
                        us? Have we not this language in our souls; that sometimes tells us it is
                        not right to serve any thing else in this world. Here, if we are faithful to
                        the divine light, we shall in proportion be able to withstand every

                        give all that is necessary. If the Scriptures were absolutely necessary, he
                        had power to communicate them to all the nations of the earth. For he has
                        his way as a path in the clouds; he knows how to deal out to all his

                        has dispensed a suitable law, to answer every purpose, as completely as the

                    <p>Sermon XI. Trenton, 293. "There is nothing can give us faith but God. Faith
                        is the gift of God. But this faith in creeds and the traditions of our
                        fathers, what is it? It is worse than nothing. We had better have no faith
                        at all. It is no better than the faith of devils. Thou believest that there
                        is one God; thou dost well: the devils also, believe and tremble." Who are
                        the devils?&#8211;Apostate men and women, who go contrary to God. They are
                        all devils. Every thing that is in opposition to the will of God is a devil.
                        In short, <hi rend="italic">they are nothing</hi> but what opposes the law
                        of light and the spirit of truth in the heart; <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> but what is in opposition to the law of God; and that
                        devil is in us all; <hi rend="italic">as sure as the kingdom of God is in
                            us</hi>, so sure the devil is in us. Were you ever tempted by any devil
                        but one in your own souls? No: you never were.&#8211;There it is that we
                        come to know God, and no where else. It is the only place where he is

                    <p>Such are the absurd, inconsistent, and antichristian sentiments of Elias
                        Hicks; and <hi rend="italic">to support these</hi>, the compilers of the
                        pamphlet have adduced their quotations from the writings of primitive
                        Friends. It being fully proved, and well known, that not only Elias Hicks,
                        but many of his adherents, do openly and <choice>

                        and the authenticity, and divine authority of Holy Scripture; and the
                        compilers having made their extracts purposely to prove that our early
                        Friends were coincident in their faith; we consider, that the publication of
                        the pamphlet, is, undeniably, a renewal of the often refuted charge against
                        the Society, of denying the doctrines of the christian religion.</p>

                    <p>The Light of Christ was as all-sufficient for salvation in the days of
                        Cornelius as it is now; It could as easily have unfolded to him, the counsel
                        of God, as to bid him send for Peter to tell him what he ought to do. But
                        because the Lord ordained the use of instrumental means, was it any reason,
                        why Cornelius should reject the teaching of Peter, as being subordinate to
                        the Spirit? If when Peter came, Cornelius had said to him, I have the Light
                        in myself&#8211;this is all-sufficient for my direction and government; I
                        "have no need to go to books or men;" thou may go thy way, I have no need of
                        any human teaching; would this have been honouring and reverencing the
                        Light, or is it probable that Cornelius would have been favoured with its
                        further illuminations ? Certainly not&#8211;it would have been <hi rend="italic">pretending</hi> honour to the Spirit, while at the same
                        time, he was despising those very means which the Spirit of Christ had
                        sanctified for his use.</p>
                    <p>Let those in the present day, who are making use of this specious but
                        dangerous and delusive reasoning, against the use of the Sacred Volume,
                        remember, that in all ages and dispensations of the world, it has pleased
                        Almighty God to teach his people not only immediately but
                        instrumentally&#8211;immediately by his grace and good spirit, and
                        instrumentally by the Holy Scriptures and his faithful servants. Both of
                        these are blessings, sanctified and given for our use; and although the
                        revelations of the Holy Spirit are above all other teachings, yet they are
                        not at our command; and if we slight and reject the secondary means, which
                        are given forth by the same Spirit for our instruction in righteousness, we
                        do as certainly rebel against, and deny the Holy Spirit, and whatever
                        pretences we may make to the contrary, set up in its stead, our own
                        self-confident spirit as judge in the case.</p>
                    <p>The next quotation, on page 72 of the pamphlet, is taken from William Penn's
                        "Guide Mistaken, and Temporizing Rebuked, or a brief reply to Jonathan
                        Clapham's book, entitled, A Guide to the True Religion." It is contained in
                        his 12th section or paragraph, in which he discusses the Guide's first
                        article of true religion; viz. that there is one God, of an infinite,
                        perfect, and spiritual nature, subsisting in <hi rend="italic">three
                            glorious persons</hi>. To which distinction of <hi rend="italic">persons</hi> William Penn replies&#8211;</p>
                    <p>"As for his strange distinction of the Deity, which he enforces on the faith
                        of all that value their eternal welfare, I cannot find one Scripture that
                        will bear him out; and if they had been of so much credit with this Guide,
                        as to have been by them led into their undeniable form of sound words, he
                        would not have intruded tradition for Scripture, to the creed of any, but
                        rather have inserted the text or phrase itself, whose authority might have
                        commanded an assent: and it had become him to give the world a reason for
                        his requiring a submission to, and credence of his doctrine, rather than
                        barely to draw up so many articles, and thus imperiously to call on all for
                        a subscription, as they would be saved; especially since he cannot but know
                        how strongly these very points have been debated in ancient councils, and
                        not less controverted by modern persons of reputation and learning." [Here

                    <p>inference, I say, is as irrational, as it would be for any to conclude, that
                        because we say of the shining and appearance of the Sun, there is the Sun;
                        or the Sun there appears; therefore we exclude the Being of the Sun
                        elsewhere. For its virtue is communicated to our natural bodies, every one
                        having in measure, some enjoyment of the virtue or light of the natural Sun,
                        which is light to the eye, even as the outward eye is light to, or of the
                        natural body; and whosoever they are, whose invisible senses are quickened
                        by the influencing virtue which proceeds from the eternal Sun of
                        righteousness, do thereby see and discern, that these things are according
                        to the clear manifestation of Truth in their inward parts; and from a true
                        sense thereof, can of a truth give this certain testimony, that Christ, the
                        Lord, by his holy, quickening spirit, hath appeared in them, to the
                        quickening of their immortal souls; and that through believing in the
                        light, and obedience to his appearance, being come out of that state which
                        is reprobated by the Lord, can of certain experimental knowledge say, Christ
                        is in us the hope of glory. And so when we direct people to this Word,
                        Light, Law, Grace and Spirit, we do not thereby intend, that Christ Jesus,
                        the Light of the World, and Gift of God, is not the true Saviour, Redeemer,
