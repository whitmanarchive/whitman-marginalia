            Memory.—Nothing makes this faculty so good, as
            the employment of it.—Locke.—
            
            
            
            Many trouble themselves about
            conforming to laws.—A great poet
            is followed by laws—they conform to
            him.

                Plutarch's LivesPlutarch's Lives—
            Amiot's translation (French) 1558
            in Greek text, at Paris,—1624
            First English translation—during reign of Queen Elizabeth
            
            Dryden, with many others in Co. also made a translation
            "a motley work,"
            
            Plutarch—born in Bœotia, in Greece, about the year 50 of
            the Christian era
            studied (like the general Greek youth)—acquired a
                great art of memory—read all the books (MSS.)
                of his time—leaned toward the tenets of Pythagoras.—
                —was of patrician family—supposed wealthy—
                —had two brothers, his associates in study and amusements—
                he always speaks of them with pleasure and affection—
                —Probably traveled into Egypt—Certainly into Italy
                —studied Latin quite late in life—never made much progress
                
                Lectured in Rome—So Lectures, it seems, there
                were, even in those days;)
                quite like the modern
                fashion, they seem to have been.
                Plutarch had a good
                reputation at Rome.—
                —some say he was preceptor
                to the Emperor Trajan
                
                Notes, in the time of Plutarch, were unknown
                in literary compositions—this accounts
                for his digressions and tedious episodes.—
                
                Late in Life retired to Chæronea, a philosopher, priest.—
                
                Was married—had five children, four sons &amp; a daughter
                had a good wife.—
                
                I suppose he attained a good old age—"a long life"
                
                Most of his writings, with many Lives, are Lost—those
                that remain being but a portion of what he wrote
