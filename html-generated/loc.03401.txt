            "What is Apollo," says Addington Symonds in
            his Genius of Greek Art chapter, "What is Apollo,
            but the magic of the sun, whose soul is light?
            What is Aphrodite but the love-charm of the
            sea? What is Pan but the mystery of Nature,
            the felt and hidden want pervading all?"
