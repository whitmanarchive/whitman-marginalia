          Dryden 1631 to 1701
          Dryden seems to have been of 
          vigorous make, sharp‑tempered—used his 
          poetical talent to make money, show 
          up his enemies,—those of the opposite 
          party, noblemen, politicians, &amp;c.—He 
          sings a good deal in the inflated, 
          distressingly classical style of those times
               
            
                     
             
                
                
                    JEREMY TAYLOR.
            [JEREMY TAYLOR, Bishop of Down, Connor, and Dromore,—one of the 
            greatest of the great Divines of the Church of England,—was the son of a 
            barber at Cambridge. He was born in 1613. He says himself that he was 
            solely grounded in grammar and mathematics by his father." In his thirteenth 
            year he was admitted a sizar of Caius College, Cambridge. By a sizar 
            was then understood a poor student, who performed humble offices in the 
            college. Out of this rank have come some of the most eminent of our scholars. 
            Very early he obtained the patronage of Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury; 
            who placed him at All Souls' College, Oxford, and nominated him, by a stretch 
            of authority, Fellow of that College. In 1637 he was appointed to the Rectory 
            of Uppingham; but his living was sequestrated in the Civil Wars. For 
            some years he suffered poverty and imprisonment; he kept a school; he was 
            a dependent upon private bounty. But he labored unremittingly; he preached 
            and he published. Upon the Restoration, in 1660, he was nominated by the 
            king to his Irish Bishopric. Here he resided for seven years, discharging his 
            duties with the most exemplary industry, and endeavoring to win all men to 
            his fold by unremitting love. His period of prosperity was not of long duration. 
            He died of a fever in 1667, in his fifty-fifth year. The character of 
            Taylor's writings which was given by his successor, Dr. Rust, in his funeral 
            sermon, is not an exaggeration:—They "will be famous to all succeeding 
            generations for their greatness of wit, and profoundness of judgment, and 
            richness of fancy, and clearness of expression, and copiousness of invention, 
            and general usefulness to all the purposes of a Christian." Reginald Heber, 
            the admirable Bishop of Calcutta, has prefixed an excellent biography of 
            Jeremy Taylor to the valuable edition of his works in 15 vols. There is also 
            a complete edition, sold at a moderate price, in three large volumes, printed by 
            Mr. Childs, of Bungay.]
            
                    
                    
                    
                        
                
            
            
          
            
               
                    
             
                
                
                    SMOLLETT.
                    [TOBIAS SMOLLETT, whose novels will continue to be read in spite of their 
                    defects as works of art and their habitual coarseness, was the descendant of 
                    an old Scottish family, and was born at Cardross, in 1721. He was apprenticed 
                    to a surgeon at Glasgow, and served as a surgeon's mate in a ship of 
                    the line. Many of his early adventures are supposed to be told in his "Roderick 
                    Random." He came to London in 1746, and entered upon a career of 
                    authorship, which he pursued till his death in 1771. Inferior to Fielding in 
                    knowledge of character, he is equal to him in describing scenes of real life; 
                    but the poetical power, without which no work of fiction can be perfect, is 
                    wholly wanting in his writings. He had amongst his literary brethren a turmoil 
                    of controversy; and his position, as the Editor of the "Critical Review," 
                    gave him the opportunity, which some anonymous critics know how to exercise, 
                    of gratifying his vanity and love of power, with slight regard to truth 
                    and justice. He is, however, represented as a generous man, and exhibited 
                    much kindness to the needy writers by whom he was surrounded. The state 
                    of letters at that period is admirably described in a paper on Johnson, by the 
                    Right Hon. T. B. Macaulay, from which we shall take the liberty of quoting 
                    in this volume. Smollett has painted a literary scene at his own hosue, in 
                    his "Humphrey Clinker," which is, perhaps, not a greatly exaggerated picture 
                    of the class of men who lived by the pen, when "the age of patronage 
                    had passed away, and the age of general curiosity and intelligence had not 
                    arrived."]
                    
                    
                     
                    
                
                
            
            
                
                    
               
                    
             
                
                 
                PASCAL.
              [BLAISE PASCAL was characterized by Bayle as "one of the sublimest spirits 
              in the world." He was born in 1623; he died in 1662. His genius led him 
              to the strictest inquiries of human reason; his piety compelled him to the 
              most complete submission of his reasoning faculty to the truths of revelation. 
              Up to his twenty-fifth year he devoted himself to the pursuits of science; 
              thenceforward, to the time of his early death, his mind was dedicated to religious 
              contemplation. His "Pensées" furnish a monument of the elevation 
              and purity of his devotional feeling; his "Lettres Provençales," in which he 
              assailed the morality of the Jesuits, with a power of logic and of wit which 
              have never been surpassed, show how completely his religion could be separated 
              from the enthusiasm of his temperament, and the ascetic practices of his 
              life. It has been said of him that he knew exactly how to distinguish between 
              the rights of faith and of reason. The passage which we select from his 
              "Pensées" is thus noticed by Dr. Arnold:—"The necessity of faith, arising 
              from the absurdity of scepticism on the one bandhand, and of dogmatism on the 
              other, is shown with great power and eloquence in the first article of the 
              second part of Pascal's 'Pensées,' a book of which there is an English translation 
              by no means difficult to meet with."]
                      
                    
                      
                    
                
                
            
                
                    
               
                    
             
                
                  
                    DR. FRANKLIN.
                  [We give a paper by the celebrated Dr. Franklin, which has been perhaps 
                      as much read as anything ever written, but which may be new to many of 
                      our younger readers. It has been often printed under the name of "The 
                      Way to Wealth;" but we scarcely know at the present time where to find it, 
                      except in the large collection of the author's works. "Poor Richard" was 
                      the title of an Almanac which Franklin published for twenty-five years, when 
                      he was a printer in America, and the sayings in the following paper are extracted 
                      from those Almanacs. His subsequent career as a man of science and 
                      a statesman exhibits what a man may accomplish by unwearied industry and 
                      a vigilant exercise of his reasoning powers. The great characteristics of 
                      Franklin were perseverance, temperance, and common sense. There have 
                      been many higher minds, but few more formed for practical utility. Benjamin 
                      Franklin was born at Boston, in 1706; he died in 1790.]
