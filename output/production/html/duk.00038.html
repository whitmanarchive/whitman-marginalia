            <p class="tei_p"><span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">PEOPLE</span> seem to have an idea that facts are every
            thing in the business of the world—the only 
            considerations in the philosophy of human progress.
            Opposed to what is merely imaginary, facts are
            allowed to have much dignity. Your practical
            reasoners look for facts; facts "are the jockies for 
            them"—such as they can see, hear, handle, or 
            demonstrate; while the imaginations are mostly held
            synonymous with the worthless, the unsubstantial
            and the ridiculous. They seem to say in the spirit
            of one of Congreve's characters—we forget which—
            "fiddle-faddle, don't tell me of this and that and
            every thing in the world; but give me mathematical demonstration; but we
            think "under leave of Brutus and the rest," that
            facts do not seem, and have not seemed to be so 
            exclusively essential to "the cosmogony of the 
            world," to the history and progress of mind and the
            general business of things, as some solid authorities
            think. Without troubling our heads, in this gossiping 
            paper, with the subtleties of Berkley and others,
            who knock all creation into the compass of a man's 
            perceptions—establish the column of the unsubstantial
            universe on the pentagonal base of the senses—
            we have an idea that a vast amount of the fictitious 
            and imaginary is blended with our regular business
            of being, doing, and suffering. Human nature has, in
            all times, contrived a little gilding, to make the bitter 
            pill of life go down. Tasso truly says—in his Invocation
            to the Virgin Mary for a muse—at the opening
            of his "Gerusalemme Liberata"—</p>

            touched in this way, but the contents of it have
            always been dashed with large doses of the same
            emollient. Reality is not such a delightful thing,
            after all. The false and the phantasmal have ever
            been considered the necessary complements, as it
            were, of our condition here.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">If we take away from the amount of what the
            world possesses that which belongs and is due to the
            imagination merely—what is not authentic, and
            could not be sworn to in a court of justice—what
            will be left? Let us take it away—and what then?
            There is a sudden solitude in the world. The beautiful 
            is vanished, and the hard, blank remnant of 
            things is full of gaps, and desert places, disastrous
            flaws and a strange silence. There is nothing now,
            but facts in this macrocosm. But, believe us, 't is a
            very rude, cold place to live in—much worse than
            ever it was before; and that—in the opinion of the
            pale pessimist over the way there—was bad enough
            in all conscience. They who first found out this
            world, and roamed about on it, had scarcely called it
            very good when they began to make it better, by
            peopling its too extensive solitudes—creating phantasms
            and imaginations for it, where there were
            none before. The unclothed reality of things was
            too bare and blank, beautiful as it was, for the first
            human beings that walked the earth. They looked
            to the elements, and the infinite host of heaven, and
            following their unanswerable instincts, they began
            to make mysteries, airy fabrics and visions. They 
            imagined a god for the cope and the clouds of the
            firmament, and he wielded the thunderbolts from a
            high mountain; another, shaped after the most
            perfectly formed of men, resided in the sun

            the sea, and imagined a crowd of lesser beings to
            haunt its caverns and depths. The forests were
            sacred to the universal Pan—his fauns, sylvans and
            satyrs; every oak had its hamadryad, every river
            its naiad or potamid; the oreads took charge of the
            flowery meadows, and the napææ wandered forever
            in the shady valleys. Impatient of mere

            What a throng of splendid deeds, of heroic and beautiful

            women and brave men, moving in gorgeous panorama 
            over the vast back-ground of antiquity—is 
            extinguished in the darkness! The creations of the 
            ancient poets and imaginative writers have filled up a 
            space in the earlier ages of the world, which without 
            them would be a blank and lost to the human mind, 
            as much as the pre-Adamite chaos is. What a 
            disinheritance it would be to take away the Iliad and 
            Odyssey! to obliterate Hector, the kind-hearted and 
            manly hero; and Priam with his mighty sorrows a 
            suppliant for his dead son; and the warring Achilles—

            and cities, and the varying manners of men! Not 
            alone would much be wanted in the want of these 
            venerable works, but in the want of all that literature 
            which they inspired and gave rise to in after 
            time. The succeeding poets and dramatists of 
            Greece and Rome drew light from Homer, as Milton's 
            stars did in their golden urns from the sun. 
            They took his historic imaginations and characters 
            as their models, and reproduced them in forms which 
            the world will not willingly let die, and which it 
            prizes nearly as much as the Institutes and Pandects 
            of Justinian, or any thing else of that authentic and

            moments, when the mind desires to be refreshed or 
            pleased it will revert, with an almost universal 
            preference, to what is imaginary, or adorned with the 
            graces of imaginative literature; and half the world 
            regard with as much attention the men and women 
            of Shakspeare and Scott as those of Hume and Prescott. 
            And how intimately and lovingly we give our 
            interest to the words and actions of these imaginary 
            beings! What a world of thought and life is in the 
            dramas of Shakspeare! There is the venerable 
            Lear, driven out into the storm, and talking the 
            finest philosophy to the wild elements, that so feelingly 
            persuade him what he is; and Hamlet, so 
            sententious in his antic disposition; the fair Ophelia, and 
            the prosy old courtier, Polonius; and the immortal 
            bed-presser, and huge hill of flesh—the greatest liar 
            and the greatest favorite in the world; and Macbeth, 
            with his terrible hags on the heath, and his more 
            terrible wife; and Richard, wooing Lady Anne, or 
            fighting desperately his last battle. Then there are 
            the witty and adventurous Rosalind, and

            Successive generations prize them as an imperishable 
            legacy, and the memory has a pleasure in conjuring 
            them up—so vivid and picturesque in their colors 
            and outlines: The hall of Cedric, the Saxon—the 
            swineherd, the templar, the gorgeous tournament at 
            Ashby de la Zouche, Friar Tuck, the storming of 
            Torquilstone, the Black Knight, fighting as if ten 
            men's strength were in his single arm; and the beautiful 
            Jewess—what splendid series of images—
            bringing back so vividly the old pomp and circumstance 
            of the feudal times! We shall never forget 
            the feelings with which we first read Ivanhoe, and 
            there found all our vague feelings of romance and 
            dreams of knightly doings put into such spirit-stirring

            Strongbow, are just as fanciful as the metrical
            romances of Scott and Moore. Then, for the annals 
            of Greece; Herodotus, the patriarch of history, sets
            down almost every thing he hears from the lying

            to call the Cyropædia of Xenophon a romance or an
            authentic narration. Plutarch romances at times
            like the Scuderis. An old English author, Taylor,

            Neibuhr has got into our old history of Rome and
            laid about him like an iconoclast. He destroys a
            crowd of our beliefs, and makes a solitude in the first 
            ages of Rome—so wonderful and picturesque in our 
            school-boy days. He makes a solitude and calls it 
            truth. He demolishes Mars, Rhea Sylvia, Romulus
            and Remus and the Wolf—Numitor, Evander, and so
            forth. Under the flourishing of his pen they make
            <span class="tei_cb"/>
            themselves into thin air in which they vanish. Then
            the Tarquins, their insolence and expulsion; Lars
            Porsenna of Clusium, the siege of Rome, Cocles on
            the Bridge and Scævola at the flaming Altar—all are
            inventions of Fabius Pictor, Ennius, Nævius, and
            others. This portion of the history of Rome, says
            the German, should be called the Lay of the Tarquins,
            and is just as authentic as the Lay of the Nibelungen!
            "Livy's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">pictored</span> page," (if we may be
            permitted to make a critical emendation of Byron's
            phrase in the spirit of Bishop Warburton's Notes on
                Shakspeare.,) is allowed to be just as fallible as it is
            brilliant. Thus we have a vast amount of what is 
            called ancient history confounded with the professed
            creations of fanciful minds; and there does not seem
            to be any very marked difference between Agamemnon
            or Ajax, and Cecrops or Codrus; between
            Æneas or Dido, and Numa or Clelia—they are all
            equally distinct or indistinct. Scott's King Richard,
            singing a roundelay and exchanging a buffet with the 
            Clerk of Copmanhurst, is as firm on the canvas as
            Alfred baking his cakes, or Canute sitting on a chair
            to rebuke his flatterers on the sea-shore.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">And even as regards the more modern and authentic
            annals of history, we do not think they have
            paid much more respect to the actual truth of things
                <span class="tei_span">
                than do the fictionists. Sir Robert Walpole used to
            say to his friends, "Don't read history; that </span><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_brown-ink tei_hi_hand_h3"><span class="tei_span">must</span></span><span class="tei_span"> 
            be false." And Sir Walter Raleigh, looking from the
            window of his prison in the Tower, and witnessing</span></span>
            a quarrel in the court-yard or the street, and the after-
            testimony of the by-standers respecting it, was
            tempted, it is said, to throw his History of the 
            World into the fire, in despair of ever being able to
            gather any thing like truth from conflicting authorities.
            And, certainly, the differences of historians—
            their doubts concerning motives, and their disagreements
            concerning facts, tend to give us very unsettled 
            ideas of history in general. Writers have 
            sent Col. Kirke down to us from James the Second's
            reign with a very black and bloody renown. But
            he was not half so black as he was painted by the
            whigs; and the story of the poor girl whose husband
            he hanged before her eyes, in the morning, though she
            dearly purchased his life on Kirke's own terms, is
            pronounced by Ritson to be an impudent and bare-faced
                <span class="tei_span">
                lie. The story is much older than Kirke.
            Richard the Third is also one of the historical
            reprobates; though it is not unlikely that the young
            princes were not murdered in the Tower, and that
            Perkin Warbeck was really the prince after all; as
            truly as the surreptitious, warming-pan prince is
            known to have been the true son of James the</span></span>

                Second, in spite of the Protestant historians. Then
                there are Jack Cade and Wat Tyler; these have
                been receiving cruel wrong at the hands of the 
                annalists. They dared, in an age when the rights of
                the people were imperfectly understood, and the influence
                of the feudal system still strong in the nation,
                to take up arms and go to war with the king and the
                nobles for liberty! Their sufferings and and provocations</span></span>
                were undeniable, and their spirit was certainly heroic
                —kindred to that which glowed in the bosoms of

            is remarkable to see this myriad-minded man, so full of the finer humanities of our nature, yet incapable

            set upon him in the senate-house, is not quite so

            character or fact, so to speak, are furnished by the
            fancies and after-thoughts of the narrators, or fabricated
            wilfully for a purpose. We need not go very
            far back in history to discover the truth of this. In a
                <span class="tei_span">late memoir (Achille de Vaulabelle's) of the "Two
            Restorations," we are told that an old story of the 
            consternation of the members of the Directory, on its
            violent dissolution by Bonaparte, in 1800, was a false 
            one. There was no hurry-skurry, nor jumping out
            of windows, any more than when Oliver Cromwell
            put an end to the Long Parliament. Again, that

            terribly damaged, this ship sunk with all on board,
            her flag flying, and the crew shouting, "Long live
            the republic!" Carlyle adopted this version in his 
            history, and makes quite a cartoon of it, in his own
            outlandish phraseology. But on the appearance of
            the story in an English work, a naval officer who
            witnessed the affair of the </span><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><span class="tei_span">Vengeur</span></span><span class="tei_span">, wrote a letter to
            the Times, in which he stated that, instead of going
            down with true republican devotion, the poor French

            tried to save themselves, and that some hundreds of</span></span>

            beliefs in her picturesque wildernesses, clothe them
            with the attributes of the mysterious abstract power

            peaks, the murmur of her forests and seas, the roar of
            her storms, the singing of her nightly stars, they find
            revelations and prophecies of higher and farther existences.
            In this respect, the modern poetry of nature

            They receive all their witchery from the imagination
            of him who surveys them. This faculty is 
            potentially mingled with all that is most real in nature;
            nay, it would seem to be as much a reality as any 
            thing else we call such. The preacher calls the
            world a vain shadow, and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_brown-ink tei_hi_hand_h3">the Berkleyan philosopher
            calls it a huge accident of the five</span> senses; and
                Shakspeare is inclined to think there is nothing
            that is but thinking makes it so. The practical
            men, therefore,—the directors of railways, the
            managers of stock, and the owners of electric telegraphs
            cannot be considered to have matters all to
            themselves. The poet and the romanticist control as 
            much of the "thick rotundity of the world" as they;
            and certainly the most enchanting portion. Schiller
            gives us in an admired lyric, the idea that the imaginative
            being was forgotten by Jove in the <span class="tei_span">distribution
                of the earth; but received a general invitation
            to the Court of Olympus. Our nether "maker,"
            or "finder," does still, of course, avail himself of this
            privilege; but not as one without alternative. He
            has a great share and dominion in all sublinary
            things; and his castles in the air may be found as 
            firmly fixed, after all, and as well tenanted, as any
            existing on any other element.</span></span></p>
