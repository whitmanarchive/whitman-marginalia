                    <p>This little Treatise is extracted from a more extensive
                    work, undertaken without consulting my resources,
                    and long since abandoned.—The following comprises
                    the greater part of the different fragments which
                    had been written, and which seemed to me best
                    worthy; all else destroyed.—
                    (1.) Montesquieu has only spoken of positive laws,
                    leaving his splendid structure incomplete; but we must
                    go to the very source of these laws, to trace the
                    origin of this primitive implied or expressed Covenant
                    which binds all societies together.—The <hi rend="underline">Contrat Social</hi>
                    has appeared; this forms the portico of the temple,
                    and the first chapter of <hi rend="underline">L'Esprit des lois</hi>.—We may
                    say in truth of this author—"The Human Race had
                    Lost its Title Deeds—Jean <choice><sic>Jaques</sic><corr>Jacques</corr></choice> has found Them."
                    (<hi rend="underline">Note by Brissard.</hi>)</p>
                    <p>Rousseau has given the substance of
                    his <hi rend="underline">Contrat Social</hi> in the fifth book of <hi rend="underline">Emile</hi>,
                    where traveling is discussed; and another abstract

                        <p>I wish to inquire whether, taking men as they
                        are, and laws as they may be made, some just rule
                        of administration may not be established in the
                        civil order.—In this research it will be my
                        constant endeavor to ally that which the 
                        right perm<subst><del rend="overwrite" seq="1"><gap reason="illegible"/></del><add rend="overwrite" place="over" seq="2">its</add></subst>, with that which policy prescribes,
                        that justice and interest may not be divided.—</p>
                        <p>I begin without expatiating.—I may be
                        asked Who I am—a prince? a lawgiver?—No,
                        neither; and therefore it is I write.—<del rend="overstrike">Born a

                        <p>Man is born free, yet he is everywhere
                        in fetters.—He who fancies himself the master
                        of others is only more enslaved than they.—
                        Whence this anomaly?—I know not its cause.—
                        What can legalize it?—I think I can answer.
                        Did I only consider force, and the results arising
                        from it, I should say<del rend="overstrike">,</del>: So long as a nation
                        is constrained to obey, and does obey, it <subst><del rend="overstrike" seq="1">does</del> <add place="supralinear" rend="unmarked" seq="2">acts</add></subst>

                        the same right which deprived it of liberty.
                        For all this, social order is a sacred right
                        upon which all others are based.—This right,
                        however, originates not in nature, but is founded
                        on covenants.—Now to investigate those covenants.</p></div1>

                         <p>Family organization is the oldest society
                         and the only natural one.—Yet children only
                         remain subject to the father, while they need his care.

                         independence; each is free from the other.—If
                         they still remain united it is because they
                         voluntarily elect to do so.—This common liberty
                         is a consequence of the nature of man.—
                         His first law is that of watching over his own
                         preservation.—Subsequently, the chief is the symbol
                         of the father,—the people, of the children<subst><del rend="overwrite" seq="1">,—</del><add rend="overwrite" place="over" seq="2">;</add></subst> and 
                         all being born free and equal, none can alienate
                         their liberty except for their own interests.—The 
                         sole difference is, that in the family the love of the 
                         father for the children compensates him for the 
                         cares he bestows, <span rend="bracket-left" from="#note1"/><note xml:id="note1" type="authorial" resp="#h1" place="inline">

                     <p>It is doubtful, according to Grotius, whether
                         the human race belongs to a hundred men, or 
                         these hundred men belong to the human race;

                         This is also the sentiment of Hobbes.—See the
                         human species thus divided into herds of cattle,
                         each having its chief, who guards but to devour
                         it.—As a shepherd is by nature superior to his
                         flock, so the human shepherds.—Thus reasoned
                         the Emperor Caligula, according to Philon, proving
                         plausibly enough that the kings were gods, or
                         the people beasts.—</p>
                         <p>The philosophy of Caligula is revived in
                         that of Hobbes and Grotius.—Aristotle had
                         said, before them all, that men are not
                         equal by nature, but that some were born
                         for slavery, and some for dominion.—Aristotle
                         was right, but he mistook the effect for the cause.
                         Every man that is born in slavery is born for
                         slavery; nothing is more certain.—Slaves lose
                         everything in their fetters; even to the desire
                         of quitting them; they love their servitude, as
                         the companions of Ulysses loved their brutishness.
                         If there are slaves by nature, it is because
                         there have been slaves against nature.—Force
                         made the first slavery; cowardice has <choice><orig>per-<lb/>

                         Noah, the father of the three great monarchs who
                         divided the universe, like the children of Saturn,
                         whom we seem to recognize in them.—</p></div1>

                         <p>The strongest man can never be strong enough
                         to be always master, unless he transforms force
                         into right, and obedience into duty.—From
                         this arises the right of the strongest, a right
                         which is seemingly claimed in irony, but really
                         laid down as a principle.—But will they not
                         define this word for us?—Force is a physical
                         power; I cannot see what morality can result 
                         from its effects.—To yield to force is an act
                         of necessity, not will.—At the most it is an
                         act of prudence.—In what sense can this
                         be a duty?—</p>
                         <p>Let us assume this pretended right for a 
                         moment.—Nothing but inexplicable nonsense
                         results from it; as the effect changes with
                         the cause, and every force which surmounts
                         the first one, succeeds in right.—So long as
                         we can disobey successfully, we do so lawfully;
                         and, if the strongest is in the right, the only
                         point is to prove who may be the strongest.
                         Of what avail is a right which perishes when
                         force ceases?—If we must obey by force, of

                         <p>"Submit yourselves to the higher powers."
                         If this means, yield to force, the precept is a 
                         good one, but superfluous.—I answer that it
                         will never be violated.—All power comes

                         surrender my purse to force,—but when I can
                         regain it, am I obliged by conscience to give 
                         it to him?</p>

                         remark upon which every social system
                         should be based—namely—That instead of
                         destroying natural equality, the social compact,
                         on the contrary, substitu<subst><del rend="overwrite" seq="1">ting</del><add rend="overwrite" place="over" seq="2">tes</add></subst> a civil and
                         legitimate equality for the physical inequality
                         that nature has caused among men,—and
                         That, however unequal they may be in respect
                         to strength or genius, all become equalized
                         by strength, and by right.—</p>
                         <p><hi rend="underline">Note.</hi>—Under bad governments, this equality is
                         but seeming and illusory, serving only to maintain
                         the poor in their misery and the rich in
                         their usurpations.—In this case the laws
                         are always advantageous to the possessors,
                         and injurious to non-possessors.—from
                         which it follows that the social state 
                         can only be beneficial to men when 
                         all possess some, but none too much,
                         property.—</p>
