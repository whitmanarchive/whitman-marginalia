                            "And first and foremost, the people. Webfoots
                            they are called, from a tradition that exists in
                            California and other envious localities, that it
                            rains here sometimes; indeed, that it rains
                            so much that the inhabitants, on the 'natural
                            longing theory,' receive web feet, that they may
                            paddle around comfortably. I believe this to be
                            a slander. But the people, the masses, are out
                            in force. With a population of less than one
                            tenth of that of Wisconsin, with but one little
                            piece of railroad of fifty miles, there are here to
                            day not less than twenty thousand people. From
                            ten, from twenty, from a hundred, from a hundred
                            and fifty miles away, men, women and children
                            are here, in covered wagons, with tents and provisions—
                            they have come up here, some of them
                            having been eight days in making the journey.
