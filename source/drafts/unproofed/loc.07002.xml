                                            good thing," Mrs. Alice Eames, music teacher, suggests
                                            in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, "if some of the people
                                            who spend small fortunes in giving their daughters
                                            musical educations would adopt the French idea of having
                                            the voice trained for conversation by a good singing
                                            teacher. Persons with sensitive ears have often sighed
                                            when a pretty and refined woman opened her mouth to drop
                                            pearls of wisdom in a voice of shocking discordance. The
                                            follows neglect of the voice in youth. A child, eight
                                            ears old, whose voice is pitched so high or so low as to
                                            be unmusical, should be taken in hand at once and taught
                                            to talk in a tone that best suits the vocal organ, An
                                            hour's lesson every day for three months will do it. If
                                            the harsh tones of the child are in a low key the voice
                                            should be tested on different keys until one is found
                                            which gives musical sounds when the conversational tones
                                            are all based upon it. Then there should be practice
                                            every day until the child becomes accustomed to using
                                            the new tones with ease."</p>

                                        <p>Rev. Solon Lacur, lately of Denver, addressed the Emerson
                                            College of Oratory yesterday on the philosophy of Ralph
                                            Waldo Emerson as related to oratory. He elucidated the
                                            "oratory" is a growth from within. A sublime abandonment
                                            to the divine impulse for the expression of truth is its
                                            highest result. Emerson said, "Matter obeys spirit as
                                            clouds the wind." The first step of this art is finding
                                            the relation of the body to the soul. The second is the
                                            renewal of the body by the mind. the philosophy of
                                            Emerson reflected truth as the water the stars. Every
                                            attitude is an effort of the soul for expression. Great
                                            souls are tongues of fire. The violin is an instrument
                                            by which a great player moves the hearts of audiences.
                                            These maxims and illustrations were seen to be in spirit
                                            of Emerson's teachings, and many were quoted from the
                                            philosopher concerning man's individuality, and applied
                                            tot he method of teaching the expression of wisdom,
                                            virtue, beauty and love, by the growth of the soul while
                                            conscious of these emotions and powers.</p>

                                LEARNED TO READ.</hi></hi></fw>
                    <fw type="pageNum" place="top right">17</fw>
                    <p>Two radical distinctions separate the Italian and the French languages: one,
                        of sound; the other, of accent. The Italians have no <hi rend="italic">e</hi> mute. The Italians pronounce the <hi rend="italic">u</hi>, not
                        in the French way, but like the English <hi rend="italic">oo</hi>; as for
                        the French diphthong <hi rend="italic">eu</hi>, they have nothing like it at
                        all. Besides, the French <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, the French <hi rend="italic">o</hi>, and particularly the French <hi rend="italic">e</hi>, have intermediate shades of sound that are never completely
                        indicated by the French accents, whether acute, grave, or circumflex. How is
                        it possible, for instance, to make a foreigner understand that the <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in <hi rend="italic">cette</hi> is neither as open
                        as in <hi rend="italic">téte</hi>, nor as sonorous as in <hi rend="italic">colére</hi>, nor as sharp as in <hi rend="italic">bétail?</hi></p>
                    <p>Accentuation presents even graver difficulties. The Italian language is rich
                        and varied in accentuation; the French very poor. We Frenchmen like to glide
                        over the syllables, hardly resting on any except the last; whereas, to an
                        Italian ear the value of the accent, the place of the accent, possesses a
                        very decided, indeed, an almost indispensable, charm. How to rid my
                        interpreter of her strong inbred tendency to accentuate? How accustom her,
                        for instance, to skim lightly over the first three syllables of Semiramis,
                        dwelling only on the last one, when in <hi rend="italic">Se-mira-mi-de</hi>,
                        the sonorous Italian word of five syllables, the <hi rend="italic">ra</hi>
                        makes itself heard with so much roundness and force?</p>
                    <p>After some careful reflection, I wrote out <hi rend="italic">Beatrice's</hi>
                        part in strong, heavy letters, on lines pretty far apart. These letters I
                        then marked with three kinds of signs in red ink. The first consisted of
                        lines drawn up and down or vertically; the second were curves drawn all
                        along the word or longitudinally; while the third were marks placed over the
                        syllables, pretty much as the dactyls and spondees are marked in our school
                        prosodies.</p>
                    <p>The object of the vertical or up and down lines was to <pb xml:id="leaf006v" facs="loc_ap_00084.jpg" type="verso"/><fw type="header" place="top"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">THE ART OF READING</hi></hi></fw>
                        <fw type="header" place="top left">18</fw> kill, to utterly annihilate all
                        the <hi rend="italic">e</hi> mutes, that is, all the <hi rend="italic">e</hi>'s which the French never pronounce, but which the Italians
                        always feel strongly disposed to pronounce. For example, in the phrase, <hi rend="italic">Madame, faites-moi le plaisir</hi>, the up and down lines
                        would kill the final <hi rend="italic">e</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Madame</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">e</hi> of <hi rend="italic">faites-moi</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">e</hi> of <hi rend="italic">le plaisir</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The longitudinal and curved lines, starting from the first syllable and
                        pouncing plumb on the last, said plainly and distinctly: "Hurry up, hurry
                        up! don't lag on the way!" Every instant, Madame's Italian instinct would
                        fain dwell on some particularly trying part of the word, but the inflexible
                        red curve was there !" Go on! go on! push on to the accent!"</p>
                    <p>Finally, the marks placed over the vowels whose intermediary sounds do not
                        exist in Italian, recalled to her eyes, by a characteristic sign, some
                        particular intonation, with which I had already made her ears and tongue
                        quite familiar.</p>
                    <p>By this simple method, thanks to the musical annotation, thanks to several
                        weeks' pretty hard work, but thanks particularly to the wonderful
                        intelligence and the still more wonderful <hi rend="italic">grit</hi> of the
                        artist – a fighting artist, I used to call her – we at last
                        succeeded, not in depriving an elegant Italian lady of her Italian accent
                        – that I never expected nor even attempted – but in leaving her,
                        so to speak, no more than its savor, its aroma, just enough to render her
                        speech strange but pleasant, quaint but far from ridiculous – in
                        short, piquant, interesting, and decidedly charming.</p>
                    <p>You see that I had by this time exchanged the <hi rend="italic">rôle</hi> of pupil for that of master. <span rend="singleLine-left" hand="#h4" xml:id="b001" from="#b001" to="#b002"/><span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h4" xml:id="b003" from="#b003" to="#b004"/>It was a new but most important step on the road of
                        self-instruction. Teaching is perhaps the best possible way of learning. A

                        teacher of elocution. His interpreters are often nothing better than
                        inexperienced beginners, with little in their favor beyond a pretty face 01
                        a pretty voice. No matter for that; they are to such an extent the material
                        part of his ideal personages, the tangible clothing of his conceptions, that
                        he must take them just as they are, without ever thinking of exchanging them
                        for others. He must face the difficult task of breathing a soul into these
                        pretty statues. Every new idea becomes a new lesson, and the greater the
                        number of ideas the harder the work.</p>
                    <p>Besides, there comes a day, resuming every old experience and preceding every
                        new, when the dramatic author is actually thrown on himself, when he speaks
                        by himself, when he teaches by his own unaided resources – the day
                        when he reads his piece for the committee by whom it is to be judged and the
                        players by whom he expects it to be acted. An important and difficult
                        matter! His task is to make his idea understood, to turn it into a living,
                        comprehensible essence. The fate of his work lies in his own hands, or
                        rather in his own voice. Will it be accepted or refused? Will it fail or
                        succeed? The answer to these important questions depends in a very great
                        measure indeed on how he accomplishes his task. Reading it, is, in fact, the
                        first performance of his work, only without costume, or scenery, or actors,
                        and with all the parts to be represented by one single individual.</p>
                    <p>Reading a play, and taking a part in it, are two very different things. The
                        actor has but one <hi rend="italic">rô</hi>le to represent; the reader
                        represents them all. <span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h4" xml:id="b005" from="#b005" to="#b006"/>The actor is a single musician taking his part
                        in the orchestra; the reader is the whole orchestra itself. He must bring
                        out in succession every age, every sentiment; every moment he must

                        he desires to produce being above all things an impression complete and
                        distinct, though evanescent, he must give every character its full value,
                        but no more than its full value; he must assign every character its own
                        place, and keep it there; in short, by his fleeting words he must succeed in
                        raising up before the imagination of the audience a new picture, but
                        complete, living, and striking!<anchor xml:id="b008"/></p>
                    <p>In fact, I know of no task more difficult, no feat more trying, and,
                        considering that I have had fully forty years' incessant converse and
                        intercourse with the most eminent artists of our day, I think you will
                        acknowledge that, in delivering this opinion, I can flatter myself with the
                        idea that I ought to know something touching the subject.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, my third and concluding teacher was the Collége de France<hi rend="superscript">17</hi>, where, in 1848, I delivered a course of
                        lectures on the <hi rend="italic">Moral History of Woman</hi>, and another
                        in 1866, on <hi rend="italic">Parents and Children in the Nineteenth
                            Century</hi>. There I was brought for the first time into direct and
                        uninterrupted contact with the great public; there I learned both the rules
                        imposed and the resources furnished by the presence of a numerous audience;
                        and there I completed my education. Not that I mean to say, either, that I
                        was then or am now anything like a real master in the art of reading. I have
                        known artists, Samson among the rest, possessing too many claims to this
                        title to permit me to advance any such pretensions. I simply mean that I had
                        studied my course, taken my degree, and was now bachelor of the science.
                        Then the very natural idea occurred to me that I should write my thesis. In
                        other words, I thought I might render some service to the public in general
                        by collecting together and issuing all these scattered <pb xml:id="leaf008r" facs="loc_ap_00087.jpg" type="recto"/>

                        mine, not, of course, in the shape of a scientific treatise, but in a little
                        pamphlet, not altogether indeed without order, and perhaps occasionally even
                        rather bordering on the didactic, but still rather recalling the familiarity
                        of a lecture than aspiring to the dignity and stateliness of a book.</p>
                    <p>The project once formed in my mind, my next step was to go and talk it over
                        with a friend.</p>

                    <p>it is in fact everything but an art. Good reading is not a thing to be
                        learned. Of course I don't mean to deny that the exercise of this natural
                        gift will not suggest some useful rules: <hi rend="italic">physical
                            rules</hi>, don't speak too much or read too much, as we must not walk
                        too much or eat too much; <hi rend="italic">common sense rules</hi>, don't
                        read too loud, or read too low, or read too fast, or read too slow; <hi rend="italic">taste and modesty rules</hi>, don't read what you do not
                        understand, and if you do understand it, try to make your hearers understand
                        it. But beyond such general, summary, common-place instructions as these,
                        which could all be easily comprised in a few lines, I can find in reading
                        none of those clear, precise, tangible rules, founded on principles, which
                        constitute an art. The whole art of Reading, in fact, lies in a nutshell:
                            <hi rend="italic">read as you speak!</hi>"</p>
                    <p>For Saint-Marc Girardin's taste I always entertained the greatest respect,
                        and with his rare sincerity I was well acquainted. But on this particular
                        subject I was fully convinced of the correctness of my own opinion. Besides,
                        underneath all this fluent and confident criticism I heard a certain little
                        sentence continually resounding. He never said this little sentence in words
                        to me; most probably he never said it in words to himself; no matter, there
                        it was, bubbling up bright and clear through the transparent flow of his
                        language: "The fact of the matter is, I, Saint-Marc Girardin, read well
                        though I never learned to read; therefore, learning to read is useless."</p>
                    <p>My reply was somewhat as follows:</p>
                    <p>"Dear friend, there is no denying that there is some truth in what you say,
                        as there must be some truth in everything said by all men of wit, even on
                        subjects which they have never studied. Now, though a Professor at the

                    <p>I quietly resumed:</p>

                        questioned; and certainly reading is not one of those arts or trades that
                        are emphatically closed to you forever if a careful apprenticeship has not
                        initiated your youthful years into their mysteries. That several readers who

                    <p>"Nothing simpler. In your course of lectures at the Sorbonne I heard you read

                        your wit, nor your superiority, nor your authority. The more successfully he
                        imitates you, the less likely he will be to please. Now nothing is really
                        and substantially good except what can be imitated without danger. That is
                        the final test. You read, therefore, with talent, no doubt, but you do not

                        as you know, enjoyed quite a reputation as a reader, a reputation well
                        deserved, I admit, as long as he read his own verses. His hoarse voice, his
                        rough gesticulations by which no doubt he imagined he showed his
                        independence, his little tuft of hair sticking out of the top of his head
                        like the comb of a cock, and his jovial intonations, were all the exact
                        representation of his peculiar talents, lively certainly, but a little
                        coarse. Add to this, he took the greatest possible pleasure in his own
                        productions, and nobody admired Viennet more than Viennet<hi rend="superscript">25</hi> himself. All this, as you may very well
                        suppose, gave his delivery, whenever he read his own verses, a glow, a heat,
                        a fire that carried away the audience. I was asked one day to read some
                        verses of Viennet's at the Academy. I refused pointblank. 'Neither myself,'
                        I observed, 'nor the poem could have the least chance of success. 1 should

                    <p>"I conclude that <hi rend="underline" hand="#h4">we must not call a reader a

                            most decidedly to his success – the man being, as it were, thrown
                            in with the discourse.</hi> I conclude also that we must exclude
                        altogether certain choice natures, certain exceptional organizations, such

                        conclude, in the third place, that ordinary humanity, the majority, the

                        He strings it on at once to his previous conquests, and unites all three

                        more rebellious, and of a more particular nature. It is a failing at once
                        material and spiritual, mechanical and intellectual. It no doubt often
                        proceeds from some malconformation – when of course nothing is left
                        for us but to apply to the doctors; but no doubt too it often proceeds from
                        lack of intellectual culture, and then some attempt at its remedy falls
                        somewhat within our own province.</p>
                    <p>People often stammer and stutter because their minds are stammering and
                        stuttering, because they themselves don't exactly know what they mean or
                        what they want, because they are too timorous, or too angry, or in too much
                        of a hurry. Impatience, timidity, want of precision in ideas – these
                        are the usual causes of stuttering and stammering, but these failings are
                        far from being without a remedy. Accustom yourself to speak slowly, with
                        deliberation, only when you are complete master of yourself, when you have
                        made up your mind definitely on what you are going to say.</p>
                    <p>A distinguished singer, whom I could easily name, stammers slightly when he

                        he sings he is sure of his ground. As long as his words are united to his
                        notes, previous practice, labor, study, custom, have made him a complete

                        is to make him a correct reader. Certainly, without fatiguing either himself
                        or others, he can read the report of some business committee, a discourse
                        before some learned body, an important paper on physical science, an essay
                        on some question in political economy, some laborious explanation, some
                        carefully prepared legal document.</p>
                    <p>The ability to do even so much well is no doubt an important and substantial
                        advantage; it establishes an intimate connexion between Reading and nearly

                        consequently rank it in the number of highly useful and almost indispensable
                        requirements.</p>
                    <p>Still, if you expressed a doubt regarding the claim of even such ability to
                        the distinction of an <hi rend="italic">art</hi>, I would not say you were
                        wrong. Even such ability would not constitute an art. To be worthy of such a
                        name, Reading must rise to the dignity of being able to reproduce works of
                        undoubted art, must become the interpreter of the masterpieces of genius.
                        For this, mere correctness is far from being sufficient; talent too is
                        indispensably necessary.</p>
                    <p>Can all men who read passably become first-class readers? All! No. Can all
                        become readers of a certain fair grade? No. Can all learn to become readers
                        with the same facility and in as short a time? No. But can all readers of
                        some natural ability aspire to become what are called good readers? Yes.
                        They can become really good readers, still, however, in strict proportion
                        with their innate intelligence and peculiar gifts. Those organizations of
                        first-rate order, endowed with highly exceptional qualities, will no doubt
                        find that their labors in their own rich soil bear the richest harvest. But
                        the others, without quite reaching the first rank, will come pretty near
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Genius is heaven-born, but talent is often acquired. Genius reinforced by
                        talent produces a Talma.</p>
                    <p>In what does this especial talent consist? On what rules is it based?</p>
                    <p>Saint-Marc Girardin, as we already know, reduces all these rules to one, and
                        that one of a simplicity clear to the dullest comprehension: "Read as you
                        speak."</p>
                    <p>Girardin is not the only able, witty, but unthinking, man who not only
                        entertains this opinion but accepts it with such conviction as to consider

                    <p>Read as we speak? Certainly, if we only speak well. But which of us does
                        speak well? Don't the majority of us speak badly? Are not our ears
                        continually assailed with stammerings, hesitancies, mispronunciations,
                        misapplication of terms, offences against the simplest grammar rules, not to
                        speak of drawling, precipitancy, and nasal twang?</p>
                    <p>Mademoiselle Mars was fond of telling us about a gentleman friend of hers
                        who, though he spoke with a dreadful nasal twang, flattered himself that he
                        had quite a genius for the stage. One day he asked her to listen to his
                        recitation of a passage from <hi rend="italic">Athalie</hi>, so that she
                        could form an opinion as to his style of delivery. She bore the infliction
                        pretty well for some time, but at the end of the sixth verse she interrupted
                        with loud applause.</p>
                    <p>"Bravo! my dear sir!" she exclaimed as if transported with admiration; "what
                        depth of emotion! What nobility of expression! There is to be sure a little
                        defect in your pronunciation, but next time I've no doubt I shall find it
                        all perfectly corrected." And she sent the nuisance away quite charmed with

                        and even demands a certain negligence in our pronunciation, a sort of
                        carelessness in our utterance, a kind of voluntary remissness or
                        heedlessness which, though perhaps a grace in the speaker, would certainly

                        such a pronunciation into your reading, you would hurt every delicate

                    <p>A gentleman, who prided himself considerably on the correctness of his
                        pronunciation, came one day to Lafon49, the celebrated, but somewhat
                        overdignified, tragedian, to take some lessons in reading. In all
                        probability, however, he was less thirsty after instruction than desirous of
                        hearing himself complimented by the great artist. By way of graceful
                        deference to his teacher, he undertook to read a piece from one of Lafon's
                        most successful impersonations, <hi rend="italic">Orosmanes</hi>.</p>
                    <p>In a few moments he was declaiming the line:</p>

                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">Tais</hi> – richesses!" interrupted Lafon,

                    <p> "That's what I said, wasn't it?"</p>

                    <p>The reader made the proper correction, and resumed:</p>

                        every respect, and just as much under subjection as his own limbs. If he was
                        thinking all the time how he could manage his horse, he could never manage
                        his army; he must therefore be a double master – a war-master and a

                        minister, not a great minister indeed, but a good business minister, a
                        minister always to be found in his office, a minister that always makes a
                        point of reading whatever he signs. He represented in the Cabinet what is
                        called the serious-sensible element.</p>
                    <p>Now I ask of you to profit by this example. Are many of you likely to be
                        Cabinet ministers? That I don't know, but I do know that many of you, as
                        professors and teachers, will be compelled to speak at least an hour or two
                        every day. Several of you will present yourselves at political meetings as
                        candidates for the legislature, or for other offices in the power of the
                        people. Here, as you know, a good deal of talking has to be done, and, as
                        everybody knows, what is said depends pretty much for its importance
                        altogether on the manner of saying it. Prepare yourself therefore, young
                        man. Arm yourself beforehand for the encounter. Remember that you can rule
                        the public only on condition that you can successfully rule yourself when
                        you face it. And this you can never do unless you render yourself complete
                        master of your voice!</p>
                    <p>To render yourself a complete master of your voice, I see no better way than
                        to take an elocution teacher. Better still, take two. Besides taking the
                        regular lessons from one professor, if we want to understand our subject
                        thoroughly, we must go over it again carefully and often with a rehearsing
                        teacher. That you all know. But in the present case, the rehearsing teacher
                        must be the pupil himself! To the lessons you have received, unite the clos-

                        observation. Study everything that can give instruction. Watch faces as well
                        as listen to voices. Seek after true intonations almost as carefully as you
                        seek after truth itself. Study in particular the accents and the
                        enunciations of children.</p>
                    <p>Here a singular fact strikes us. Children are splendid elocution teachers.
                        How true, how pure, how just their intonations! Their flexible young organs,
                        readily accommodating themselves to every variety of sensation, enable them
                        to reach more daring inflexions than the ablest actor would ever dream of.
                        Have you ever listened attentively to a little girl telling some secret that
                        she has discovered, describing some mysterious scene that she has just
                        witnessed? Doesn't she remind you of little <hi rend="italic">Louise</hi>
                        talking so innocently to her father in the <hi rend="italic">Malade
                            Imaginaire</hi>? She imitates every voice. She reproduces every tone.
                        You see the personages pass before you. You actually hear them talk! Well,
                        just as she has got through with her story, ask her to read the very same
                        little <hi rend="italic">Louise's</hi> part in Moliere, or a few of <hi rend="italic">Joas's</hi> verses in <hi rend="italic">Athalie</hi>. You
                        are astounded. What has become of her naturalness? Where are those tones so
                        varied and so appropriate? You hear nothing but the sing-song, tiresome,
                        stupid monotony so peculiar to the reading of school children. These great
                        professors of elocution have not the first idea of a principle of their
                        art!</p>
                    <p>As an example just in point, I can cite an instance in my own experience

                    <p>"How perfectly true to nature the little thing is? How thoroughly artless!
                        How beautifully simple! It is easy enough to see that none of your elocution

                    <p>The critic was fully as wrong in his conclusions as critic can well be. For a
                        whole month I had hardly done anything else but teach the child her part,
                        word by word, tone by tone. Was the part one above her age? By no means.
                        Some of the very tones I taught her I had actually learned from my little
                        actress herself. Like all children, when giving way to her emotions, she had
                        created them instinctively. But the instant one of these original tones came
                        into her part, the instant she began to read one of her own characteristic
                        phrases, her naturalness vanished like smoke. What she had said with
                        wonderful grace when speaking on her own account, she said coldly and even
                        with incorrect expression the moment she began to speak for another. In
                        fact, it cost me a good deal of time, patience, and labor to bring her back
                        to what she really was, and to make her learn over again the very tones that
                        she herself had taught me.<anchor xml:id="b034"/></p>

                        admiration; but one day, on attempting to read it aloud, I was suddenly
                        stopped short by a difficulty in the execution so great and so strange that
                        it set me at once a-thinking. The first part was all simple and easy enough,
                        but the second part seemed heavy, involved, and almost impossible to be read
                        properly. It seemed to be dragged after Fontaine's lumbering stagecoach. It
                        consists of no less than seventeen printed lines, and these seventeen
                        printed lines form but one single sentence. One single sentence without a
                        moment's pause! No period, no colon, not even a semicolon. Nothing but
                        commas; while interlacing phrases, succeeding each other continuously and
                        springing up anew at every turn of the sentence, prolonged it
                        unintermittingly to its final end, and compelled you, though panting for
                        breath, to follow up its meaning into all the ramifications of its winding
                        sinuosities. When I found myself at the end at last, I felt somewhat like a
                        broken-winded horse, but, as I said before, the very strangeness of the
                        thing set me reflecting.</p>
                    <p>"Why in the world," I asked myself, "did Racine take the trouble to compose a
                        sentence so exceedingly long, so laboriously complicated, but withal so
                        artfully put together?"</p>

                        the chaos of dramatic poetry, he purposely employs a style that is violent,
                        abrupt, void of art, without toning, without transition! But, to give us a
                        visible picture of the stage as Corneille had created it, he constructs one
                        long sentence, where phrases are strung on phrases, mutually linked
                        together, and mutually sustaining each other, where everything is in
                        harmony, unity and totality, where, in short, everything is co-ordinated,
                        subordinated and highly elaborated. Such were Corneille's tragedies of <hi rend="italic">Polyeuctes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rodoguna</hi>, in

                    <p>"Easily enough: you simply read Pascal as you had read Bossuet."</p>
                    <p>"Well, suppose I did? Aren't they both –?"</p>
                    <p><span rend="singleLine=right" hand="#h4" xml:id="b047" from="#b047" to="#b048"/>Yes, they are both sublime authors; they both write with
                        undoubted genius; but in temperament and method both are diametrically
                        opposite. Bossuet, even when writing at his very best, is only speaking; in
                        every one of his lines we hear the tones of the human voice; in every one of
                        his sentences, however long or labored it may be, we can always detect the
                        breathing and the movement of speech; never has writer been more of a
                        painter and more of a poet. But painter and poet are both fused in him into
                        a third person, dominating over them all, the orator!</p>
                    <p>"In Pascal, on the contrary, this third person is the geometrician. Pascal
                        too is a painter and a poet. But though the poet and the painter color his
                        phrases, it is the geometrician that constructs his sentences. Bossuet's
                        sentences are winged, they fly like an eagle; Pascal's sentences are a
                        theorem, and develop themselves like a theorem: they always advance but
                        never run! Now, Mr. Reader, what have you been trying to do? To fly! to run!
                        nothing less! <anchor xml:id="b048"/> This wonderful style of Pascal's you
                        have actually succeeded in making dull and heavy, simply because you tried
                        to make it light and airy! Here! Please listen for a minute or two while I
                        endeavor to express by a slight change of style the alluring charms of a
                        writer who, though ever eloquent, is never an orator!"</p>
                    <p>Then without much hurrying, with very little pausing, I set myself to
                        represent that force which gains new strength as it progresses, <hi rend="italic">vires acquirit eundo</hi>, like a squadron of heavy
                        cavalry, advancing with accelerated motion, and making the earth tremble

                        without its disillusions. If it discovers beauties, it detects faults as
                        well. As Sainte Beuve has phrased it, "A reader aloud is at once a critic
                        and a judge.'" Yes, a stern and severe judge, with an eye quick to alight on
                        unsuspected weaknesses.</p>
                    <p> What wretched discoveries of the kind have I fallen upon myself even
                        unawares! How many writers and writings that I used to admire passionately,
                        that possibly you admire passionately now, I have found totally unable to
                        stand this terrible test! A French phrase describing a self-evident thing
                        says, <hi rend="italic">it jumps into your eyes;</hi> it would be just as
                        correct to say <hi rend="italic">it jumps into your ears</hi>. Eyes hurry
                        hastily over the page, skipping lightly over the weak spots, instinctively
                        avoiding the dangerous. But ears catch everything. Ears make no skips! Ears
                        have sensibilities, susceptibilities, penetrations, of which eyes are
                        totally incapable! The little word which, read in silence, slipped past us
                        unawares, when read aloud, suddenly assumes enormous proportions! The
                        expression which your eye had scarcely noticed, is absolutely shocking to
                        your ear! And the more numerous is the audience listening to the reader, the
                        keener and more sensitive is that reader's clairvoyant insight!</p>

                        said that his critical faculty, thoroughly aroused and highly excited by
                        this thrilling contact with a public audience, has really become a kind of
                        divination.</p>
                    <p>Shall I confess that the experiment of reading aloud one day suddenly
                        destroyed one of the dearest and most charming of my youthful enthusiasms? A
                        writer whom I had always set up high in the first rank, had to step down
                        unceremoniously to the second. I admire him still; eloquent and pathetic I
                        shall always acknowledge him to be, but his name is no longer on the list of
                        my great gods. It is to Massillon that I allude.</p>
                    <p>Massillon, in my opinion, has a magnificent treasury of words, but an
                        extraordinary dearth of phraseology. His vocabulary is truly royal, but his
                        skill in employing it has little variety or breadth. Bossuet's style is
                        continually relieved by new and unexpected turns of expression, which stamp
                        every sentence with a peculiar and striking cast of countenance. In La
                            Fontaine<hi rend="superscript">58</hi>, so many verses, so many
                        different styles of thought. But once Massillon hits on a certain kind of
                        sentence, he holds on to it with a deathgrip, page after page. Like a
                        horse-car unable to leave its tramway, like a canal-boat which cannot quit
                        its canal, on he goes, without turning an inch to the right or left, and on
                        you go with him. What is the consequence? A<pb xml:id="leaf023r" facs="loc_ap_00115.jpg" type="recto"/>

                        <fw type="pageNum" place="top right">91</fw> monotony, that at last palls on
                        the ear and actually stops the reader. Besides, even the splendid profusion
                        of his words is not without its uniformity. His incomparable talent of
                        setting forth a single thought under such a variety of shapes had for a long
                        time astounded me, dazzled me. I used to take for a new idea what was
                        nothing but the same idea presented again and again under various different
                        forms. But reading aloud soon convinced me that there was something
                        artificial in this exuberant display. I began to feel as you feel at one of
                        those pieces where the same actor pretends to represent five or six
                        different personages, whereas in reality the only thing changed is the
                        costume.</p>
                    <p>Take a page of Saint-Simon59 if you want to realize more fully the idea that
                        I wish to convey. He too repeats the same idea under twenty different
                        shapes, but he does so as a clever magician turns one object into fifty by
                        the blazing reflection of dazzling mirrors; he does so with the fire and
                        heat of a man who, under the influence of a burning impression, always
                        considers his expressions too feeble to adequately represent his ideas. He
                        fights and struggles with his words to compel them to express what he means.
                        He whips his language, spurs it, tortures it, drives it, overloads it, until
                        at last it obeys him and becomes just as passionate, fiery, and headlong as
                        himself!</p>
                    <p>I have often tried to read Saint-Simon aloud, but never, I must acknowledge,
                        with more than indifferent success. In the reading line I know of no harder
                        kind of work or anything at the same time more interesting than a lively,
                        rough and tumble, body to body, tug with this terrible giant. It is Jacob's
                        struggle with the angel. You are sure to be conquered. But your very defeat
                        has done you good; it has given you more nerve and a readier confidence in
                        attempting new encounters.</p>

                        and the movement in which our thoughts run," and this definition embodies
                        one of the fundamental rules of the art of reading. <span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h4" xml:id="b057" from="#b057" to="#b058"/>The first thing therefore to be done by a reader, when he enters on the
                        study of a new piece, is to look after its order so as to be able to
                        determine its movement &#8212; movement being in reality no more than
                        animated order. He must discover the plan underlying the structure, the
                        sketch beneath the picture, the framework beneath the edifice, and thus
                        arrive at the great original trace-lines.<anchor xml:id="b058"/></p>
                    <p>The consequence of all this labor is perfectly natural. The reader's insight
                        becomes amazing. No one penetrates more deeply into the secrets of the
                        composition. Many a defect in unity, many a fault in harmony, which the
                        gloss of execution and the glare of detail keep completely concealed from
                        the eye of the multitude, force themselves irresistibly on the notice of the

                    <p>Delaunay, of the <hi rend="italic"/>Comedie Française<hi rend="superscript">45</hi>, favored me with his company one day at
                        dinner. During the evening he said, in the course of conversation:</p>
                    <p>"Have you any objection to my attempting before your friends a little
                        recitation in poetry that I have never given elsewhere? It pleases myself so

                    <p>His success in fact was decided; the end of the piece particularly, the
                        Prayer, produced a profound and general emotion. Never before had the

                    <p>Starting for the shores of Britanny, three months afterwards, I took care to

                        arrival I set myself to work. There I was, strolling among the rocks, my
                        ears ringing with the grand bass of the "far-resounding sea," as I recited
                        aloud these splendid verses. I say <hi rend="italic">recited</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, but recited, for one of the advantages of our

                        are surrounded by a troop of such friends as Lamartine<hi rend="superscript">62</hi>, Corneille, La Fontaine, Victor Hugo<hi rend="superscript">63</hi>. With them we hold pleasant converse in the depths of the
                        forest shades; with them we talk about our own daring lines; with them we
                        pass hours and hours of delightful intercourse, hunting after some fleeting
                        emotional tone, tender and true, finding it at last, announcing the
                        discovery with delight and asking them how they are pleased with our
                        success.</p>

                    <p>An answer to this is easy. That a Reader, who knows his business, has a
                        perfect right to bring out the beauties of his subject into the strongest
                        relief, and at the same time do all he can to diminish its defects, does not
                        admit of a shadow of doubt; but this liberty is allowable only when he has
                        realized these beauties himself and discovered these defects himself. Us
                        therefore he may dupe occasionally but himself never!</p>
                    <p>Some time afterwards I told Delaunay of my disillusion.</p>
                    <p>"It does not at all surprise me," was his reply. "I had myself detected that
                        very flaw which you found so displeasing and had readily seen that the first
                        part of the composition was much superior to the second. But I had also
                        discovered that this Prayer, which you must acknowledge really contains
                        several very touching lines, was capable of some new and telling effects. I
                        expected it to move you, as it had moved me, by its very suggestions of
                        human weakness. I contrived to exert my art in abridging a little of the
                        first part, in toning it down somewhat, so as to be able to set the second
                        in stronger light."</p>
                    <p>You see then that Delaunay had not really entrapped us into unwarranted
                        emotion. He had simply improved on his author, and this he could have done
                        only on the condition of not being entrapped himself.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">DE MUSSET'S</hi>name has naturally brought us to an
                        important question in the study of our subject: the application of the art
                        of Reading to poetry.</p>
                    <p>How are verses to be read?</p>
                    <p>Judging by what is usually done, even on the stage, the grand art of reading
                        poetry consists in making the audience think you are reading prose. I was
                        sitting one evening in a theatre, quite close to a box occupied by two
                        ladies elegantly dressed and evidently of some distinction. All at once one
                        of them exclaims:</p>
                    <p>"Good gracious! They 're giving us verses!"</p>
                    <p>And up they rise and out they go.</p>
                    <p>For the loss of their company the actor certainly was not to be blamed; he
                        had taken all kinds of pains to conceal the monster; he had so successfully
                        broken up, dislocated and chopped the lines to pieces that the "poetry"
                        reminded me of some murdered hero's body so gashed and disfigured by wounds
                        that his own mother could not have recognized him.</p>
                    <p>The amateurs naturally and blindly imitate the artists. Indeed they can't
                        very well do anything else. We know only what we have learned, and very few
                        suspect that here anything <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to be learned. I have
                        never heard poetry read in public without being astonished unto admiration
                        at the innumerable methods by which people contrive to <fw type="footer" place="bottom right"><hi rend="smallcaps">100</hi></fw>

                        <fw type="pageNum" place="top right">101</fw> read it badly. Some, suffering
                        from I know not what incomprehensible nightmare of harmony, conceive it to
                        be their conscientious and inexcusable duty to envelope their verses in a
                        sort of unctuous rhapsodical singsong, killing off all the rhymes, softening
                        off all the outlines, shading off all the movements, until they succeed at
                        last very thoroughly in producing upon the listener the same nauseous
                        impression as you experience when you take some insipid greasy draught.
                        Others again, laboring under the delusion that everything should be
                        sacrificed for the sake of "truth," never seem to give themselves the least
                        concern whatever regarding either the rhythm, the rhyme, or the prosody;
                        and, when they unfortunately remember that the cesura should be somewhere
                        about the sixth foot, they always contrive to make a pause in the very spot
                        where, of all places in the world, a pause is sure to make the whole verse
                        ridiculous.</p>
                    <p>In opposition to these strange errors, allow me to present you with three
                        maxims, absolute and final, the truth of which I shall prove by the simplest
                        examples:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>1. The Art of Reading is never so difficult and never so necessary as
                            when it is applied to poetry. Only long and careful study can make you a
                            proficient.</item>
                        <item>2. You must read verses as verses, and poetry with the ear of a
                            poet.</item>
                        <item>3. The interpreter of poets must become their confidant; that is, they
                            must reveal to him what they reveal to no other.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>To demonstrate these three axioms, one poet and one alone may be taken, La
                        Fontaine.</p>
                    <p>The little detail I am now about to give must not be considered a digression;
                        in fact it will be only a shorter and pleasanter path to take you where I
                        want you to go.</p>

                    <p>La Fontaine was the first book in which I took reading lessons. My master was
                        a man of talent &#8212; perhaps he even had too much talent &#8212; with a
                        charming voice, of which he certainly made a sensible use, and with a play
                        of features, of which he just as certainly took considerably too much
                        advantage. He gave me, however, two lessons of great and equal utility, from
                        which I hope you may profit just as much as I did. He told me both what a
                        reader should always attempt to do, and what he should always carefully
                        avoid.</p>
                    <p>He had to read some fables of La Fontaine one morning at the Conservatory
                        before some literary assembly; on the way he called in on me, and said:</p>
                    <p><span rend="singleLine-left" hand="#h4" xml:id="b071" from="#b071" to="#b072"/>Come and see how a reader that knows his business presents himself before
                        a large audience. That you may profit the more from it, here is the
                        programme:</p>
                    <p>"I begin by giving the assembly a sweeping glance. This glance, circular,
                        comprehensive, and accompanied by a half smile lightly pencilled on the
                        lips, must be of an agreeable and amiable character. Its object is to
                        conciliate the good-will of the audience, to make a collection of their
                        sympathies and regards, and particularly, to make yourself the central point
                        of attraction for all eyes. Then you clear your throat a little &#8212; hm!
                        hm ! &#8212; as if you were going to begin &#8212; but you don't begin !
                        &#8212; not yet ! &#8212; you wait until the silence is as still as death.
                        Then you advance your arm &#8212; your right arm, mind &#8212; with a
                        graceful curve of the elbow &#8212; never forget that &#8212; the elbow is

                        But what do you mean by simply? Do you mean smoothly, unvaryingly, or, in
                        short, prosily? You do? Well, then I am sorry to be compelled to differ with
                        you <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi>. That is not reading La Fontaine, it is
                        killing him! <hi rend="italic">Tradulore traditore</hi>! It is not
                        translating him, it is betraying him! La Fontaine is the most involved poet
                        of the French language. No writer unites in one single individual so many
                        contrarieties. No poetry is so rich in opposition! His well-earned nickname
                        of <hi rend="italic">Bonhomme</hi> (simpleton), his well-known reputation
                        for "verdancy," the thousand and one anecdotes told of his fits of
                        abstraction, have all somewhat blinded us with regard to his unquestioned
                        genius. The man has set us all wrong in estimating <hi rend="italic">the
                            poet</hi>. Of the simplest manners? Yes. As an individual, somewhat
                        eccentric, possibly foolish? Granted. But put a pen into the hand of this
                        simpleton, this Poor Poll &#8212; he is simpleton no longer! He is the
                        quickest, the deepest, the sharpest, the knowingest! We are nothing beside
                        him! We are simple amateurs; he is the most accomplished of artists! He has
                        himself revealed his secret:</p>

                        everything is carefully calculated beforehand, premeditated, sought after
                        with effort, while, at the same time, by a miraculous gift, everything is
                        harmonious, flexible, natural! <hi rend="underline" hand="#h4">Art</hi>

                        the key to this wondrous union? His delightful simplicity of heart naturally
                        passes into his verses, and then fuses itself so thoroughly with his great
                        literary talent that, while his knowledge enables him to represent
                        simplicity with consummate skill, his simplicity imparts its own airy
                        gracefulness to knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Another contrast, another difficulty, and consequently another merit. In La
                        Fontaine all extremes meet. Side by side, in the closest union, stand tones
                        the most dissimilar, emotion, humor, power, grandeur, dignity, familiarity,
                        Gallic joviality, all elbowing each other incessantly, and all present
                        everywhere in every one of his poems. No writer that I know of has succeeded
                        so perfectly in packing so much value into so small a space! One single
                        line, often one single word of his, is sufficient to open out to your gaze
                        far extending horizons! Painter incomparable! Narrator incomparable! Creator
                        of original characters, hardly inferior to Moliére himself! And you
                        think all this can be rendered simply, unvaryingly, prosily, without effort?
                        I tell you again that it cannot! No. It is only after deep and careful study
                        that a reader may begin to think that he understands even imperfectly, much
                        less undertake to make others understand, an art so profound and so
                        elaborate.</p>
                    <p>My expressions, I confess, want clearness: to illustrate them, let us take

                        the great poets can be studied as well as La Fontaine. Only&#8212;and this
                        we must never forget&#8212;the modes of reading verse are just as numerous
                        as the modes of writing verse. Racine must not be read like Corneille, nor
                        Moliere like Regnard<hi rend="superscript">64</hi>, nor Lamartine like
                        Victor Hugo. Correct elocution varies strictly according to the nature of
                        the genius that it undertakes to interpret. Sink the faults, hurry through
                        or abridge the tedious passages, skip them even if you like, but never
                        attempt to change your author's nature! A reader who would undertake to
                        deliver <hi rend="italic">Ruy Bias</hi>, for instance, in what is called a
                        simple unaffected style would deprive the play at one blow of its most
                        predominant characteristic &#8212; its richness of coloring. If we are plain
                        with the plain, with the exuberant we must be exuberant &#8212; it would
                        never do to copy Rubens<hi rend="superscript">65</hi> with neutral tints. To
                        read an ode as we should read a fable, a lyric strain like a dramatic
                        passage, Lamartine's Stars like Florian's<hi rend="superscript">66</hi> The
                        Blind Man and the Paralytic, would be simply spreading a gray veil of dull
                        uniformity over the magnificent variety of genius's glittering garden.</p>
                    <p>But the <hi rend="smallcaps">RULE</hi> immutable, inflexible, eternal,

                        how many passages, for instance, is the intensely pathetic suggested by
                        little more than the melancholy but melodious cadence! Good-natured friends

                        bounds of Truth!" Ah! Truth is infinitely vaster than the narrow brains of

                        admiration to the fine ladies of that period; he was quite as much
                        captivated by Pascal as by Madame de Longueville<hi rend="superscript">69</hi>, and he would never exchange the great Corneille for the most

                        free from the usual fault of fanatics &#8212; he considered a single word
                        uttered in disparagement of one of his idols as a personal insult offered to

                        admirable and that I looked on the rest as absolutely detestable. Cousin

                    <p>By Jove! I thought Cousin was going to swallow me, body and bones! Most
                        fortunately, however, the session broke up at that moment precisely, and
                        everybody began to leave the room. But Cousin overtook me at the doorway and
                        permitted himself to exclaim as bluntly as you please:</p>
                    <p>"You 're probably conceited enough to imagine you know as much about La
                        Fontaine as I do?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, I rather think I do," replied I with a smile.</p>
                    <p>"You're in earnest?"</p>
                    <p>"Certainly I'm in earnest. I know more of La Fontaine than you do, because
                        you read him silently, whereas I read him aloud."</p>
                    <p>"Oh! the argument!"</p>
                    <p>"An excellent argument. Do you want to be convinced of its soundness?" "Of
                        course I do!"</p>
                    <p>Off we start down the quays, arm in arm, hotly discussing the question.</p>
                    <p>"Has not La Fontaine written nearly all his Fables in Free Verses?" I
                        begin.</p>
                    <p>"Well, suppose he has!"</p>
                    <p>"First, what are Free Verses?"</p>
                    <p>"The term itself expresses the meaning perfectly. Free verses are verses that
                        rhyme but that have no regular rhythm."</p>
                    <p><span rend="singleLine-left" hand="#h4" xml:id="b083" from="#b083" to="#b084"/>Not at all. <hi rend="underline" hand="#h4">Free Verses have just as much

                            admit,</hi><anchor xml:id="b084"/>

                        <hi rend="underline" hand="#h4">a concealed rhythm. Free Verses obey a rule,
                            a mysterious but a real rule, a rule not indeed treated of in the
                            rhetoric books, but nevertheless just as surely existing and always as
                            present in the imagination of all writers of true poetic
                            genius.</hi><anchor xml:id="b086"/> This is simply the reason why the
                        Free Verses of the Seventeenth Century are excellent whilst those of the
                        Eighteenth, except a few of Voltaire's, are all mediocre. The poets never
                        guessed the secret."</p>
                    <p>"What secret?" asks Cousin, ever ready to take fire at anything like a
                        dogmatic assertion regarding literature, though now evidently somewhat
                        mollified by my little compliment to his beloved Seventeenth Century. "What
                        secret? What mysterious rule are you talking about? Explain the meaning of
                        your hidden rhythm."</p>
                    <p>"No easy matter; still &#8212;Do you ever take a ride on horseback?"</p>
                    <p>"Very seldom &#8212; scarcely ever."</p>
                    <p>"That's bad &#8212; well &#8212; you have no doubt often heard of the famous
                        riding-masters Monsieur Baucher<hi rend="superscript">70</hi> and Monsieur
                        D'Aure?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh! haven't I? When I was minister, what endless discussions we had as to
                        which of them we should make master of the Saumur school of cavalry. The
                        Minister of War was for Baucher, one of our military men was for D'Aure. Why
                        so? Hang me if I have an idea on the subject!"</p>
                    <p>"I think I can give you one or two while I am at the same time endeavoring to
                        develop my theory regarding Free Verses."</p>
                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">Parbleu</hi>!" cries my companion. "This is something
                        quite original! Poetry illustrated by horse-riding! Go on, my dear sir! I am
                        all attention!"</p>

                        that afforded by a horse mounted, that is, subdued, mastered by Baucher. How
                        complete the domination of the man over the animal! Trembling, prancing,
                        palpitating, exulting in his strength though quite conscious of its
                        subjugation, the horse has not a muscle that is not under the most perfect
                        control. The foam flecking him, here and there, the nostrils opening and
                        closing in ardent perturbation, the net-work of swollen veins rising in such
                        high relief all over his body &#8212; all betray his life, his strength, his
                        feverish impatience, his hunger after freedom. But no matter for that! Every
                        single one of his movements is rhythmical; every single one of his paces is
                        fore-arranged; inclosed in the unyielding circle of his master's iron limbs,
                        his abounding energy itself becomes the very perfection of
                        subordination!"</p>
                    <p>"Well;" interrupts my companion, "all this I may not dispute, but what in the
                        world &#8212;"</p>
                    <p><span rend="singleLine-left" hand="#h4" xml:id="b087" from="#b087" to="#b088"/>"Wait a moment. D'Aure, on the contrary, is the dashing rider of the open
                        air. A great difference! What D'Aure requires is plenty of room. What he
                        demands of his horse is the fullest exertion of all his forces. No curbing
                        in, no reining up now; no check-reins, no martingales! spurs, if anything,
                        and a touch of the stinging lash! See the animal speeding past, nose in air,
                        eye aflame, hair and mane streaming in the breeze! Watch him as he skims the
                        plain, fleet as an arrow, light as the wind, graceful as a bird! Who is the
                        master now, the horse or the man? The man as much as ever! His is the
                        direction just as much as the inspiration! <span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h4" xml:id="b089" from="#b089" to="#b090"/>He apparently gives
                        the animal the wildest liberty, and yields with pleasure to his fieriest and
                        most uncontrollable impulse; but his fingers never abandon the guiding rein,
                        nor his arm the curbing bit!<anchor xml:id="b088"/><anchor xml:id="b090"/><pb xml:id="leaf032r" facs="loc_ap_00133.jpg" type="verso"/><fw type="pageNum" place="top right">115</fw><fw type="header" place="top"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">FREE VERSES.</hi></hi></fw>
                        <span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h4" xml:id="b091" from="#b091" to="#b092"/>So, while Baucher's horse, though a captive, subdued,
                        submissive, is as powerful in his strength as ever, D'Aure's, though
                        apparently independent as the raging blast, is as much under control as the
                        rider's little finger."<anchor xml:id="b092"/></p>
                    <p>"I think I understand you now," said Cousin with a smile. "Baucher's horse is
                        epic or Alexandrine versification, and&#8212;"</p>
                    <p><span rend="singleLine-left" hand="#h4" xml:id="b093" from="#b093" to="#b094"/><span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h4" xml:id="b095" from="#b095" to="#b096"/>Precisely! and D'Aure's is the rhythm of Free Verses. Here
                        the artist, instead of confining the play of his inspiration within a circle
                        traced beforehand, abandons it to its natural bent, gives it full
                            scope<anchor xml:id="b096"/>, follows it through all its windings,
                        expresses it in all its mobile plasticity, changes the rhythm with every
                        change of idea, and thus succeeds in imparting more justice, truth, and
                        reality to multitudes of delicate, elegant, airy, and graceful
                            sentiments.<anchor xml:id="b094"/>
                        <span rend="doubleLine-right" hand="#h4" xml:id="b097" from="#b097" to="#b098"/>But this unrestraint must never degenerate into listlessness
                        or license. The freer from a master is the true artist, the stricter and
                        severer he is towards himself.<anchor xml:id="b098"/> He is always
                        contriving therefore to relieve the freedom of the rhythm by the number and
                        variety of the rhymes, by bolder and more striking expressions, by newer and
                        more captivating ideas, so that we are always instinctively conscious of
                        power as well as of grace, of severe art as well as of playful negligence.
                        Free Verses, though not a canal with straight banks, are by no means an
                        ocean without coasts. They are rather a river whose shores are winding,
                        flexible, varying, flowery, but everywhere strictly regular in spite of
                        their apparent irregularity."</p>
                    <p>"This theory of yours may have something in it. But sustain it, pray, by
                        means of a few examples. Show me some passage where the poet says by a free
                        verse something that the regular verse could not so well express."</p>

                        no means confined to Madame Talma. <span rend="singleLine-left" hand="#h4" xml:id="b105" from="#b105" to="#b106"/>Rachel told me something one day
                        that I can never forget. She was speaking of her recitations at Potsdam in
                        the presence of the Emperor of Russia, the Emperor of Austria, the King of
                        Prussia, and other sovereigns. 'Such a flower-bed of kings,' said she,
                        'actually electrified me. Never before had I hit on truer or more powerful
                        accents. <hi rend="italic">My voice actually enchanted my own
                        ears</hi>.'"</p>
                    <p>"Were these Rachel's own words?"</p>
                    <p>"Her actual words. But that is not all. One of our first living artists has
                        often told me that he never could succeed in reaching those pathetic tones
                        of his that so profoundly affected the audience, without having previously
                        learned his part <hi rend="italic">aloud</hi>. It was his own voice that
                        touched him, guided him, and always assured him when he was right. This
                        throws some light on another strange fact, generally held inexplicable.

                    <p>"That point I waive the discussion of just now," replies my interlocutor with
                        a merry smile, "but suppose you give La Fontaine and the other great writers
                        that you undertake to interpret, meanings, allusions, and intentions that
                        they themselves never had the least idea of?"</p>
                    <p><span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h4" xml:id="b115" from="#b115" to="#b116"/>To such a supposition I should reply in the words of the
                        illustrious Corneille himself. Somebody pointed out to him one day certain
                        verses of his that were anything but clear, asking him to explain their
                        meaning. He looked at them for a while, and then replied: 'When I wrote
                        these verses, I am certain I understood them; at present I must confess they
                        are not a bit clearer to myself than they are to you.'<anchor xml:id="b116"/> Thus even the great masters, you see, do not always comprehend their own
                        mysteries. In the fire and glow of creation, they unconsciously give but
                        half expression to ideas, of the full force of which they are not probably
                        completely aware, but which are nevertheless just as real, solid, and
                        consistent as those ideas that they have most highly elaborated. Genius, as

                        himself too much? A Monologue of a hundred and twenty lyrical verses is no
                        joke either for hearer or reader! What good is emotion without a voice to
                        convey it? No matter what your stock of real emotion may be, the instant

                    <p>Let us examine the piece in detail.<anchor xml:id="b123"/></p>
                    <p>The first twenty verses, though of a decidedly poetical cast, are really

                    <p>These, therefore, I should deliver with decision, with conviction, with

                        cavil or dispute, but without any undue expenditure of lyrical effusion.</p>

                    <p>Here it was clear enough that I should not be afraid to come out strong, as
                        the saying is, to give my voice its full swing, to lift it up, higher and
                        still higher, until it should reach the nebulas!</p>

                    <p>Then&#8212;a change&#8212;absolute and complete. The ineffably mysterious
                        depths of the <hi rend="smallcaps">INFINITE</hi> are now to be represented.
                        And to represent them fitly I soon found out that the poet had limited
                        himself to terms of mysterious import, to words of oracular and shadowy
                        meaning, to tints of clear-obscure that remind us of Corot's<hi rend="superscript">79</hi> vaporous, misty, semi-diaphanous
                        canvases.</p>

                        light enough to eclipse them all, etc.)</p>

                    <p>Here, of course, I was to endeavor to depict by modulation of voice what the
                        poet had endeavored to depict by choice of words, to find shades in harmony
                        with these tints, to compose music for these verses! This pause in the
                        semi-obscurity, these notes, soft, sweet, soothing as a spirit chorus, had
                        the double advantage of reposing me a little, and preparing the way with
                        greater effect for the grand lyrical enthusiasm of the conclusion.</p>
                    <p>But I had to look out for something else in the piece. I should depict the

                    <p>Who is supposed to speak these verses? Ponsard? Not at all. Galileo. These

                        the words of the great discoverer himself. He speaks in verse certainly, but

                        saying he is in no state to receive the last rites.</p>

                        a madman howling with rage and terror? as many unimpeachable witnesses
                        testify. What does his own physician say, the famous Tronchin, who
                        introduced inoculation into France, who was neither cleric nor philosopher,
                        and who attended him at his last illness? He speaks candidly enough. "If my
                        principles had needed strengthening," he writes, "the man whose death agony
                        I have just witnessed, would have bound them up into a gordian knot. The
                        death of a good man, the pleasant close of a beautiful day, compared with
                        that of Voltaire, shows all the difference between a calm and a tempest. ...
                        In spite of my injunctions he had gone to the Academy and the last <hi rend="italic">sÉance</hi> was too much for him. From that moment
                        till the day of his death his life was one hurricane of madness. The drugs
                        that he had taken to give himself strength threw him into the most frightful
                        state of despair and insanity. I recall it now with horror. As soon as he
                        saw that what he had done to strengthen himself had produced the contrary
                        effect, death was continually before his eyes. Rage instantly took
                        possession of his soul. . . . Remember the raving madness of Orestes &#8212;

                        AbbÉ Mignot, Voltaire's nephew, had it embalmed and buried in his own
                        abbey at Scellieres, on the Seine, whence, on the destruction of the
                        monastery, thirteen years later, the remains were removed by a decree of the

                    <p>For a long time mankind will differ regarding the merits of Voltaire. Many

                    <p> Here is Victor Hugo's opinion on the merits of "King Voltaire."</p>
                    <p>"Voltaire leaves us a monument more astonishing by its extent than imposing
                        by its grandeur. It is not an edifice of the august order. It is no palace
                        for kings, it is no hospital for the poor. It is a bazar, elegant, vast,
                        easily moved through, irregular; displaying untold riches flung on
                        mud-heaps; offering to every interest, to every vanity, to every passion the
                        very thing that suits it best; dazzling to the eye, but rank to the nostril;
                        presenting impurities as pleasures; alive with merchants, tramps, idlers,
                        but seldom showing a priest or a poor workingman. Here are splendid
                        galleries thronged incessantly with wonder-lost crowds; there are dark
                        caverns which nobody boasts of having ever visited. Under those sumptuous
                        arcades you can find countless masterpieces of art and taste, glittering
                        with gold and diamonds; but for the bronze statue, with the severe and
                        classic forms of antiquity, you may look in vain. Decorations for your
                        parlors</p>

                    <p>This fondness for dwelling on ghastly scenes of blood and death and brutal
                        cruelty has been the besetting sin of his life. This too is the reason why
                        readers of coarse tastes, the immense majority, whose palates must be
                        tickled by the hottest stimulants, read him with the greatest pleasure. The
                        fact is, his irregular education, while doing much to exalt his fancy, had
                        done little to chasten or improve his taste. The dreaming boy had been
                        wandering over the splendors and horrors of Europe, instead of working at
                        school, and playing with his companions; a few years later his opening
                        imagination took greater delight in modern Spanish, Italian, German and
                        English literature, than in the master-pieces of Greece and Rome, or in the
                        deathless productions of the age of Louis XIV. Exuberant in his genius, and
                        dimly conscious of his creative power, he chafed beneath rules of art and
                        dictates of criticism, regarding them as cumbersome trammels, rather than
                        wise and safe guiding-reins. Royalty, too, had probably been never more than
                        a sentiment, and his mother's death was the first blow towards successfully
                        severing the link binding him to the old monarchic and religious school,
                        which, about this time, became known as the <hi rend="italic">Classic</hi>,
                        to distinguish it from the new school called the <hi rend="italic">Romantic</hi>. Of this school, as already stated (page 224). the
                        dramatist Lemercierhad been really the father, but Lamartine's fascinating
                            <hi rend="italic">Meditations</hi> having now made it extremely popular,
                        especially with young France, a new paper, the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>,
                        was started expressly to define and support its principles. Its articles
                        being full of life, and especially of novelty, the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> was extensively read, its doctrines proving especially
                        ensnaring to young poets, artists, and dramatists. Young Hugo in particular,
                        embraced the new doctrines with such enthusiasm that he soon became their
                        most vigorous exponent, the great Panjandrum indeed of the new mysteries.
                            <span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h4" xml:id="b126" from="#b126" to="#b127"/> The chief principles of the two schools seem to be somewhat
                        as follows: the Classic School holds that nature should be represented in
                        poetry, in art, on the stage, etc., not as she <hi rend="italic">really
                            is</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">idealized</hi>, and, whether in good or
                        in ill, <hi rend="italic">improved</hi> into what our imaginations readily
                        tell us she <hi rend="italic">ought to be</hi>. The Romanticists claim that

                        should be allowed to express nature <hi rend="italic">as it finds her</hi>,
                        in whatever order it may please, with whatever terms it may please. What
                        right, they ask, have we to substitute our fleeting conventionalities for
                        the majesty of reality? Truth to nature should be our only standard. In our
                        pictures of nature why exclude the horrible, the grotesque, or even the
                        trivial? If we admit only the beautiful, the perfect, the sublime, what
                        pretensions can we make to giving a representation of <hi rend="italic">truth?</hi><anchor xml:id="b129"/></p>
                    <p>Something like this at least was said by Victor Hugo himself in the preface
                        to a third volume of his <hi rend="italic">Odes and Ballads</hi> in 1826.
                        "What is really true is always true. Thought is a virginal and fertile soil,
                        whose productions should be allowed to grow spontaneously, and even at
                        hazard. <hi rend="italic">Regularity</hi> is one thing; <hi rend="italic">order</hi> another. Regularity is merely human; order is simply divine.
                        The poet's only model should be, nature; his only guide, truth; his only
                        books, Homer and the Bible." But it was in the preface to his first tragedy,
                            <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, 1827, that he boldly flung the new
                        banner to the breeze, and stoutly nailed it to the mast. "In creation we see
                        the ugly existing beside the beautiful, the deformed beside the graceful,
                        bathos beside pathos, the ridiculous beside the sublime, evil beside good,
                        shade beside light; why then should the artist endeavor to surpass God? Is
                        nature mutilated nature improved? Is the harmonious to be sought at the
                        expense of the complete? The time has now come for poetry to take a decided
                        step, a step, like the earthquake shock, destined to change the face of the
                        world. She will show the shadow as well as the light, the grotesque as well
                        as the sublime, the body as well as the soul, the animal as well as the
                        spirit; but she will show them as Nature shows them, mingling them, not
                        confounding them."</p>
                    <p>These fine phrases, however new, being looked upon by many as anything but

                                            said to be short-lived, but the echo of her tragic tones
                                            seems never to have died away. She was born in South
                                            Wales in 1755, and died in 1831. she came of a family of
                                            actors. Her father, Roger Kemble, her brothers, John
                                            Philip and Charles, her sister Elizabeth, and her
                                            husband, were all renowned exponents of dramatic art.
                                            Hazlitt said of her, "That as an actress, she was above
                                            all excellence," and it has been added, "that her
                                            private character was irreproachable."</p>

                                            cast aside all dramatic precedent. Once if playing <hi rend="italic">Volumnia</hi> to her brother's <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>, she was one of a

                                            with dignified and measured tread, and in cadence
                                            subservient to the orchestra, with flashing eye, and

                                            as if to repress the triumphant swellings of her haughty
                                            mother's heart, she towered above all around, and
