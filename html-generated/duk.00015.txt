                Dim foreshadowings, which Milton, I doubt not, discerned and cherished.
                The Iliad was the natural and spiritual father of the Paradise Lost—
            SEWARD.
                And the son is greater than the sire.
            NORTH.
            I see in the Iliad the love of Homer to Greece and to humankind. He was
            a legislator to Greece before Solon and Lycurgus—greater than either—after
            the manner fabled of Orpheus.
            SEWARD.
            Sprung from the bosom of heroic life, the Iliad asked heroic listeners.
            NORTH.
            See with what large-hearted love he draws the Men—Hector, and Priam,
            and Sarpedon—as well as the Woman Andromache—enemies! Can he so
            paint humanity and not humanisehumanize? He humaniseshumanizes us—who have literature
                and refined Greece and Rome—who have Spenser, and ShakspeareShakespeare, and Milton
                —who are Christendom. The Paradise Lost is (to us,) 
            nonsense, any how, because 
            it takes themes entirely out 
            of human cognizance and 
            treats them 
            as Homer treats his 
            siege and 
                    opposing armies, 
            and then 
            disputes.—
            The Iliad 
            stands perfectly 
            well and very 
            beautiful for 
            what it is, 
            an appropriate 
            blooming of the 
            poet and what he 
            had received 
            and what he believed, 
            and what to him 
            was so, and 
            what was so
            in a certain sense.—
            The Paradise 
            Lost is offensive to modern 
            science and intelligence—it is a 
            poetical fanaticism, with a few 
            great strong features, but not a 
            great poem.— over

                The Iliad has been called a Song of War. I see in it—a Song of Peace.

                It could never have been, by human power, our Paradise Lost. What would
                have become of the Seventh Book? This is now occupied with describing the
                Six Days of Creation. A few verses of the First Chapter of Genesis extended
                into so many hundred lines. The Book, as it stands, has full poetical reason. First,
                it has a sufficient motive. It founds the existence of Adam and Eve, which is
                otherwise not duly led to. The revolted Angels, you know, have fallen, and the
                Almighty will create a new race of worshippers to supply their place—Mankind.
            SEWARD.
                For this race that is to be created, a Home is previously to be built—or
                this World is to be created.
            NORTH.
                I initiated you into Milton nearly thirty years ago, my dear Seward; and I
                rejoice to find that you still have him by heart. Between the fall of the
                Angels, and that inhabiting of Paradise by our first parents, which is
                largely related by Raphael, there would be in the history which the poem
                undertakes, an unfilled gap and blank without this book. The chain of events
                which is unrolled would be broken—interrupted—incomplete.
            SEWARD.
                And, sir, when Raphael has told the Rebellion and Fall of the Angels,
                Adam, with a natural movement of curiosity, asks of this "Divine Interpreter"
                how this frame of things began?
            NORTH.
                And Raphael answers by declaring at large the Purpose and the Manner.
                The Mission of Raphael is to strengthen, if it be practicable, the Human
                Pair in their obedience. To this end, how apt his discourse, showing how
                dear they are to the Universal Maker, how eminent in his Universe!
            SEWARD.
                The causes, then, of the Archangelic Narrative abound. And the personal
                interest with which the Two Auditors must hear such a revelation of wonders
                from such a Speaker, and that so intimately concerns themselves, falls nothing
                short of what Poetry justly requires in relations put into the mouth of the
                poetical Persons.

            [June,
            Another point of difference is, the Iliad was wanted to give body and shape
                to the nebulous float of traditions . . . . and it gives them the beautiful oval
                swift‑rolling, continuing shape.—The Paradise Lost was not wanted for any such purpose
            What is in the Bible had better not be paraphrased 
            The Bible 
            is indescribably 
            perfect—
            putting it in 
            rhyme, would 
            that improve 
            it or not?
            NORTH.
                And can the interest—not now of Raphael's, but of Milton's "fit audience"
                —be sustained throughout? The answer is triumphant. The Book is, from
                beginning to end, a stream of the most beautiful descriptive Poetry that
                exists. Not however, mind you, Seward, of stationary description.
            SEWARD.
                Sir? Think of a sing
                writer going into the creative action of deity!
            NORTH.
                A proceeding work is described; and the Book is replete and alive with
                motion—with progress—with action—yes, of action—of an order unusual indeed
                to the Epos, but unexcelled in dignity—the Creative Action of Deity!
            SEWARD.
                What should hinder, then, but that this same Seventh Book should have been
                written in Prose?
            NORTH.
                Why this only—that without Verse it could not have been read! The
                Verse makes present. You listen with Adam and Eve, and you hear the
                Archangel. In Prose this illusion could not have been carried through such
                a subject-matter. The conditio sine quâ non of the Book was the ineffable
                charm of the Description. But what would a series of botanical and zoological
                descriptions, for instance, have been, in Prose? The vivida vis that is
                in Verse is the quickening spirit of the whole.
            BULLER.
                But who doubts it?
            NORTH.
                Lord Bacon said that Poetry—that is, Feigned History—might be worded in
                Prose. And it may be; but how inadequately is known to Us Three.
            BULLER.
                And to all the world.
            NORTH.
                No—nor, to the million who do know it, so well as to Us, nor the reason why.
                But hear me a moment longer. Wordsworth, in his famous Preface to the Lyrical
                Ballads, asserts that the language of Prose and the language of Verse differ
                but in this—that in Verse there is metremeter—and metremeter he calls an adjunct. With all reverence, I say that metremeter is not an adjunct—but vitality and essence; and very true
                that verse, in virtue thereof, so transfigures language, that it ceases to be the
                language of prose as spoken, out of verse, by any of the children of men. 
            SEWARD.
                Remove the metremeter, and the language will not be the language of Prose?
            NORTH.
                Not—if you remove the metremeter only—and leave otherwise the order of the
                words—the collocation unchanged—and unchanged any one of the two hundred
                figures of speech, one and all of which are differently presented in the language
                of Verse from what they are in Prose.
            SEWARD.
                It must be so.
            NORTH.
                The fountain of Law to Composition in Prose is the Understanding. The
                fountain of Law to Composition in Verse is the Will.

                A discourse in prose resembles a chain. The sentences are the successive
                links—all holding to one another—and holding one another. All is bound.
            SEWARD.
                Well?
            NORTH.
                A discourse in verse resembles a billowy sea. The verses are the waves
                that rise and fall—to our apprehension—each by impulse, life, will of its own.

                E profundis clamavi. In eloquent prose, the feeling fits itself into the process

                In prose, the general distribution and composition of the matter belong to
                    the reign of Necessity. The order of the parts, and the connexionconnection of part with
                part are obliged—logically justifiable—say, then, are demonstrable. See an
                Oration of Demosthenes. In verse, that distribution and composition belong to
                the reign of Liberty. That order and connexionconnection are arbitrary—passionately
                justifiable—say, then, are delectable. See an Ode of Pindar.

                In prose the style is last in verse first; in prose the sense controls the

                in prose you live in the abstract—in verse in the concrete; in prose you present
                notions—in verse visions; in prose you expound—in verse you enchant;
                in prose it is much if now and then you are held in the sphere of the fascinated

                I have forgot it. The lines in the countenance of Prose are austere. The look
                is shy, reserved, governed—like the fixed steady lineaments of mountains. The
                hues that suffuse the face of her sister Verse vary faster than those with which
                the western or the eastern sky momently reports the progress of the sinking,
                of the fallen, but not yet lost, of the coming or of the risen sun.

                That which to other men is an occasional pleasure, or possibly delight, and to Wordsworth

            The difference between perfect originality and
                second‑handsecondhand originality is the difference
                between the Bible and Paradise Lost.

                Seldom—seldom—seldom if ever, my dear sir. He tells his Life. His
                Poems are, of necessity, an Autobiography. The matter of them, then, is his
                personal reality; but Prose is, all over and properly, the language of Personal
                Realities. Even with him, however, so peculiarly conditioned, and, as well
                as I am able to understand his Proposition, against his own Theory of writing,
                Verse maintains, as by the laws of our insuppressible nature it always
                will maintain, its sacred Right and indefeasible Prerogative.
            To conclude our conversation—
            BULLER.

                Epos is Human History in its magnitude in Verse. In Prose, National
                History offers itself in parallelism. The coincidence is broad and unquestioned;
                but on closer inspection, differences great and innumerable spring up
                and unfold themselves, until at last you might almost persuade yourself that
                the first striking resemblance deceived you, and that the two species lack
                analogy, so many other kinds does the Species in Verse embosom, and so
                escaping are the lines of agreement in the instant in which you attempt fixing
                them.

                Would that Lord Bacon were here!
            NORTH.
                And thus we are led to a deeper truth. The Metrical Epos imitates History,
                without doubt, as Lord Bacon says—it borrows thence its mould, not
                rigorously, but with exceeding bold and free adaptations, as the Iliad unfolds
                the Ten Years' War in Seven Weeks. But for the Poet, more than another, ALL
                IS IN ALL.
            Whoever believes in the Calvinistic theology 
            —to him the thread of Paradise Lost may 
            seem strong—to all others it will be weak.—

                Sir?

                What is Paradise Lost, ultimately considered?
            BULLER.
                Oh!

                Milton's 
            mind seems 
            to have had 
            the grandest 
            sort of muscle 
            —and much 
            of the other stuff 
            that poetry 
            wants.—
            His descriptions 
            are large 
            and definite.—
            He has nothing 
            little or nice about him—but he was in too
            much with sectarian theology and with the disputes between
                    puritans and churchmen.—For instance what 
                    nations in Asia or Africa? not Christian, would
                    see any great point in his poem, if read to th
                It is, my friends, the arguing in verse of a question in Natural Theology.
                Whence are Wrong and Pain? Moral and Physical Evil, as we call them, in
                all their overwhelming extent of complexity sprung? How permitted in the
                Kingdom of an All-wise and Almighty Love? To this question, concerning
                the origin of Evil, Milton answers as a Christian Theologian, agreeably to his
                own understanding of his Religion,—so justifying the Universal GovernmentYes,
                but 
                the 
                point 
                is wrong
                at the 
                start 
                If a po
                    take what is largely dou
                even he shall surely fa
                
                of God, and, in particular, his Government of Man. The Poem is, therefore,
                Theological, Argumentative, Didactic, in Epic Form. Being in the constitution
                of his soul a Poet, mightiest of the mighty, the intention is hidden
                in the Form. The Verse has transformed the matter. Now, then, the
                Paradise Lost is not history told for itself. But this One Truth, in two
                answering Propositions, that the Will of Man spontaneously consorting with
                God's Will is Man's Good, spontaneously dissenting, Man's Evil. This is
                created into an awful and solemn narrative of a Matter exactly adapted, and
                long since authoritatively told. But this Truth, springing up in the shape of
                narrative, will now take its own determination into Events of unsurpassed
                magnitude, now of the tenderest individuality and minuteness; and all is,
                hence, in keeping—as one power of life springs up on one spot, in oak-tree,
                moss, and violet, and the difference of stature, thus understood, gives a deep
                harmony, so deep and embracing, that none without injury to the whole could
                be taken away.
            BULLER.
                What's all this! Hang that Drone—confound that Chanter. Burst, thou
                most unseasonable of Bagpipes! Silence that dreadful Drum. Draw in your
                Horns—
