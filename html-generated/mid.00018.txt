        Immortality was realized—it the influence of the
        the thought of it entereding
        into the positive acts of the people citizens
            every day; —It livinges yet sending to us in its tangible bequest to modern ages—it rebukes
            it and lookings with calm features and
        rugged quaintness to day from the slopes
        out of the pyramids.—Personal qualities
        were accepted and obeyed:—as (When
        are they not accepted and obeyed?—)
        Through them ? Sesostris more than three thousand
        years ago ruled Egypt for sixty years more than
        three score years.—He was six feet
        ten inches high and nobly proportioned
        and supple.—He was considerate of the common people.— He conquered Asia
        and Europe, honoring most those
        people that resisted him most.—
        He was a rugged, and wholesome
        and masc and masculine person,
        and in the list of Egyptian greatness comes first in th after Osiris.—
        Not only Assyria and Egypt—
        —not only Phœnicia and Lydia and
        Persia and Media and India——had their
        literature, growing out of the nature
        and circumstances and governments and enjoyments of
        the people, with mor or less specimens, of course
        long since lost of the grandests and most perfect
        
        forms of composition expression——but the men and women other nation
        other empires and states, other mighty
        and populous cities, contemporary was
        with them in other parts of the world,
        or ages antecedent of them, perhaps it may be in
        distant regions of the eastern continent
        hemisphere, perhaps or it may be in North or
        South America, had their loves and
        passions and prides and aspirations
        also typified and put in shape
        and held.—in compositions.— Language was systematic
        and passed on from age one generation to another in methods fit for answering to what was
        needed.— These other nations unknown empires
        and cities, and their literatures are unknown by name existed just as certainly
        and with the known ones, and with perhaps most like
            a date yet they certainly existed in greater vigor and fluency than the known ones.
            Travelers in every age and in all parts of the world come upon
        their dumb and puzzling relics.—
