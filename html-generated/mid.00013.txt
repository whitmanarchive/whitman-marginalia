                Grier estimates that this was written in the late 1850s (Walt Whitman: Notebooks and Unpublished Manuscripts, ed. Edward F. Grier [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 5:1838). "German Literature" refers to Joseph Gostwick's German Literature, which Lippincott published in 1854.
