            The mountain‑ash, a large shrub, 16 or 20 ft
            high—northern part of the state of New York
            —has white blossoms—blooms early in the
            spring—has then a pleasant perfume—the
            hill‑sides where it grows thickly look white
            from the blossoms.—
            
            amusements around the fire in the lumbermans
            hut—the great bright light—the songs and stories—
            The lumberman in the woods—goes
            in in the early winter—makes a hut—
            perhaps a gang of lumbermen—the
            pine is the principal timber—the
            pine grows sometimes thick as a hogshead
            —100, 150, and even 200 feet high—they
            cut it in logs of 13 feet.—The maple,
            the beech, &amp;c are good woods—hemlock,
            spruce—hardy life, healthy, robust,
            —food is largely of salt pork, beans,
            peas, &amp;c and the like.—The animals likely
            
                Story of
            to be seen are the wolf, the
            black bear, and possibly a catamount
            
            story of the catamount and the Indian of the
            Indian of the St. Regeis—The Indian lived
            in his hut in the woods—made sugar‑baskets
            —took a lot into the village—left his little son
            of five years old to take care of the hut—returned—
            boy gone—peered around up and down—saw the boy
            up in a tree in the power of a large catamount who was tossing
            him up and down—Indian at last fired—the enraged catamount
            tore
