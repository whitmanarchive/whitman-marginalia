            rather poor the earlier years, father a subordinate clergyman

            was hard up for many years afterward.&#8212;
            Resolved to make his living by writing books&#8212;
            his first work being finished&#8212;no publisher&#8212;
            tried some time&#8212;at last found one in Berlin
            &#8212;unnoticed by the reviews, except one, and
            that gave a scornful notice.&#8212;Richter
            still holds his purpose&#8212;writes another
            work, "Selections from the papers of the Devil,<subst><del rend="overwrite" seq="1">"</del><add rend="overwrite" place="over" seq="2">"</add></subst>
            ransacked high and low for a publisher, but
            found none&#8212;until some years afterward&#8212;
            Stood out in costume, wore his shirt open
            at the neck, &amp;c&#8212;horrified all the "magisters"
            &#8212;held out in costume seven years, and then
            returned to orthodoxy&#8212;</p>
            <p xml:id="p1a" next="#p1b">Living in the most scanty manner for
            some ten years, in 1793, when 30 years
            old, he began to be known and his works
            marketable, "the Invisible Lodge," "Hesperus"
            &amp;c. about that time. (novels.)&#8212;The Reviews
            acknowledged him, and he went on writing
            and receiving good returns.&#8212;He wrote
            many many works, (some sixty or more vols. I believe)
            He married 1798, a good wife of rather upper grade.
            Had a pension from a princely prelate, in 1802
            and continued for life.&#8212;His eldest son died 1821</p>

            <p>Richter seems to have been a thoroughly
            irregular genius, according to the laws and models.
            He was gay, sparkling, a rattler, profound,
            &#8212;one of those that to new readers do not
            please, but once falling in with him, and
            reading his books, it is amply made up.&#8212;

            <p>His person was huge, queer, irregular.&#8212;</p>

            <p>I should say that he was unnatural,
            and lurid, judged by the calm and wholesome
            models.&#8212;He is full of love, and appears
            to be the originator of much of the
            soft and sentimental ways of the swarms
            of tale‑writers of the last thirty years, in

            <p>Carlyle certainly introduced the
            German style, writers, sentimentalism,
