            An Ossianic ¶: Margaret Fuller, benighted and alone
            on Ben Lomond.—
            
                
                    
                        
                            
                            For about two hours I saw the stars, and very
                                cheery and companionable they looked; but then
                                the mist fell, and I saw nothing more, except such
                                apparitions as visited Ossian on the hill-side, when
                                he went out by night and struck the bosky shield,
                                and called to him the spirits of the heroes and the
                                white-armed maids with their blue eyes of grief.
                                To me, too, came those visionary shapes; floating
                                slowly and gracefully, their white robes would unfurl
                                from the great body of mist in which they had
                                been engaged, and come upon me with a kiss pervasively
                                cold as that of death. What they might
                                have told me, who knows, if I had but resigned
                                myself more passively to that cold, spirit-like
                                breathing!
                        
                    
                
            
            
            Ossian must not be
                despised—it means
                that kind of thought
                and character growing
                among a rude com-
                bative illiterate people, heroic,
                dreamy, poetical,
                on mountains, not
                on rich lowlands, not with placid
                gods and temples, not with a cultivated
                benevolence, conscientiousness, agreeableness,
                or constructiveness.—
            How misty, how windy, how
            full of diffused, only half-meaning
            words! —How curious a study!
            ☞—(Don't fall into the Ossianic, by
            any chance.)
            ? Can it be a descendant of the
            Biblical poetry? —Is it not
            Isaiah, Job, the Psalms, and so
            forth, transferred to the Scotch
            Highlands? (or to Ireland?)
            
            ? The tremendous figures and
            ideas of the Hebrew poems,—
            are they not original?—for
            they are certainly great—
            (Yes they are original
