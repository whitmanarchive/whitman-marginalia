                    THE MUSES.—The muses are described in
                        Mythology as daughters of Jupiter and Mnemosyne.
                        They are believed to preside over poetry, music,
                        and all the liberal arts and sciences, and were generally
                        allowed to be nine in number. Calliope presided
                        over epic poetry and eloquence, and is represented
                        as holding a close rolled parchment, and
                        sometimes a trumpet. Clio, who was the goddess
                        of history, is represented as holding a half-open
                        scroll. Melpomene, the inventress and goddess of
                        tragedy, is represented as holding a tragic mask, or
                        bowl and dagger. Erato presided over lyric, tender
                        and amorous poetry. She is always represented
                        as crowned with roses and myrtles, holding a lyre
                        in her hand. Terpsichore was the goddess of dancing,
                        and is represented as crowned with laurel, and holding
                        a musical instrument. Urania, the muse of astronomy,
                        is represented as holding a globe and a
                        rod with which to point out objects. Thalia was
                        the patroness of comedy. She was called "The
                        Blooming One," with fair flowing hair, and generally
                        holds a comic mask. Polymnia, the ninth
                        muse, presided over singing and rhetoric. She was
                        represented veiled in white, holding a sceptre in
                        her left hand, and with her right raised, as if ready
                        to harangue.185410,000 new books were

            'WHEN a man has once resolved upon a
                subject,—then, for a text,' says Sterne,
                'Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia
                and Pamphylia, is as good as any in the
                Bible.' Without pretending to be so easily
                satisfied as that very accommodating divine,
                we shall choose, for our present text, the
                London Catalogue; nor shall we be without
                grave precedents, both in his discourses and
                in those of much better theologians, if we
                should ultimately allow the text to play but
                an insignificant part in the sermon.
            Our readers will readily surmise that it
                is not our intention to criticisecriticize this curious
                volume, or to trouble them with any specimens
                of its contents. But though we have
                little to say of it, it has a great deal to say
                to us; and, in truth, we apprehend there
                are few productions of the press more suggestive
                of instructive and profitable reflection.
                Still, as it only conveys wisdom in
                broken and stammering accents, we must
                endeavourendeavor, according to our ability, to give
                clearer utterance to some of the lessons it
                teaches.
            This closely printed book contains 542
                pages; and, after all, comprises a catalogue
                of but a small fraction of the literature of
                the time; in fact, only the titles of the new
                works, and new editions of old works, which
                have issued from the British press between
                the years 1814 and 1846; and not all of
                these. To this prodigious mass each day is
                added fresh accumulations; and it is impossible
                
                
                not to speculate a little on the probable
                consequences.
            Some may perhaps, at first, be inclined to
                predict that mankind will in time be oppressed
                by the excess of their intellectual
                wealth; and that, operating like the gold of
                Villa Rica (to which it would seem that we
                might soon have to add that of California),
                the superabundance of the precious metal
                may lead to the impoverishment and ruin of
                the countries so equivocally blessed. It
                may be feared that a superficial and flimsy
                knowledge, gained by reading a very little
                on an infinity of subjects, without prolonged
                and systematic attention to any, will be the
                result; and such knowledge, it can hardly
                be disputed, will be in effect much the same
                as ignorance. Singular, if the very means
                by which we take security against a second
                invasion of barbarism, should, by its excess
                of activity, bring about a condition not very
                much better! 'A mill will not go,' such
                reasoners will say, 'if there be no water;
                but it will be as effectually stopped if
                there be too much.' In brief, it may seem
                to be one of those cases, if ever there was
                one, in which old Hesiod's paradoxical
                maxim applies—that 'the half is more than
                the whole;' or, for that matter, a much
                smaller fraction.
            And this dreaded result would certainly
                be realisedrealized if men were to attempt to make
                their studies at all commensurate with the
                increase of books around them. Compelled
                to read something of every thingeverything, it is certain
                they would know nothing of any thinganything.
                And, in fact, we see this tendency more or
                less exemplified in the case of vast numbers,
                who, without definite purpose or selection

            the books he borrowed—an event which, we
            fear, does not always happen.
            It is probable, indeed, that a comparatively 
                small number of well selected books,—even 
                when our own,—would, generally, be likely 
                to form a sounder and more serviceable 
                knowledge than the unlimited range of a 
                large library. Most readers must have been 
                aware of the fastidious mood with which, in 
                moments of leisure, they have stood before a 
                goodly assortment of attractive writers, and 
                instead of making a substantial repast, as 
                they would have done with less to distract 
                their choice, have humored the vagaries of 
                a delicate appetite—toyed with this rich 
                dainty and that—and after all have felt like a 
                school-boy who has dined upon tarts—that 
                they have spoiled their digestion without 
                satisfying their hunger!
            But without stopping any longer to examine 
                this paradox,—whether the multiplication 
                of books is to produce a diminution of 
                knowledge or not,—there are other consequences 
                of the prodigious activity of the 
                modern press far more certain to arise, and 
                which well deserve a little consideration.
            One of the most obvious of these consequences 
                will be the disappearance from the 
                world of that always rare animal, the so-
                called 'universal scholar.' Even of that ill-
                defined creature called 'a well-informed 
                man' and 'general student,' it will be perpetually 
                harder to find exemplars; while 
                assuredly the Huets, the Scaligers, the Leibnitzes, 
                must become as extinct as the ichthyosaurus 
                or the megatherium. It is true that, 
                in the strict sense of the word, such a creature 
                as 'the universal scholar' does not, and 
                never did exist. But there as certainly have 
                been men who have traversed a sufficiently 
                large segment of the entire circumference 
                of existing science and literature, to render 
                the name something more than a ridiculous 
                hyperbole. It is commonly indeed, and 
                truly said, to be impossible for the human 
                mind to prosecute researches with accuracy 
                in all, or even many different branches of 
                knowledge; that what is gained in surface 
                is lost in depth; that the principle of 
                the 'division of labor' strictly applies here 
                as in arts and manufactures, and that each 
                mind must restrict itself to a very few limited 
                subjects, if any are to be really mastered. 
                All this is most true. Yet it is equally 
                true that in the pursuit of knowledge the 
                principle of the 'division of labor' finds 
                limits to its application much sooner than in 
                handicrafts. The voracious 'helluo librorum' 
                is not more to be suspected of ill-
                digested and superficial knowledge, than he 
                whom the proverb tells us to avoid, (though 
                for a very different, and as we suspect, less 
                
                
                valid reason), the man 'unius libri.'* A 
                certain amount of knowledge of several subjects, 
                often of many, is necessary to render 
                the knowledge of any one of these serviceable; 
                and without it, the most minute knowledge 
                of any one alone would be like half a 
                pair of scissors, or a hand with but one finger. 
                What is that amount must be determined by 
                the circumstances of the individual, and the 
                object for which he wants it; the safe maximum 
                will vary in different cases.
            There are opposite dangers. The knowledge 
                of each particular thing that a man 
                can study will always be imperfect. The 
                most 'minute philosopher' cannot pretend 
                perfection of knowledge even in his little 
                domain; and if it were perfect to-day, the 
                leakage of memory would make it imperfect 
                by to-morrow. No subject can be named, 
                which is not inexhaustible to the spirit of 
                man. Whether he looks at nature through 
                the microscope or the telescope, he sees 
                wonders disclosed on either side which extend 
                into infinity,—the infinitely great or 
                the infinitely little,—and can set no limits 
                to the approximate perfection with which he 
                may study them. It is the same also with 
                languages and with any branch of moral or 
                metaphysical science. A man may, if he 
                will, be all his life long employed upon a 
                single language, and never absolutely master 
                its vocabulary, much less its idioms; but, 
                like the ancient, after many years of solitary 
                application, have still to proclaim himself 
                a foreigner to the first apple-woman he 
                meets, by some solecism too subtle for any 
                but a native ear to detect it.
            The limits with which any subject is to be 
                pursued must therefore be determined by 
                utility; meantime, it is certain that one 
                cannot be profitably pursued alone. Such, 
                it has been well observed, is the strict connexion 
                and interdependence of all branches 
                of science, that the best way of obtaining a 
                useful knowledge of any one, is to combine 
                it with more. The true limit between too 
                minute and too wide a survey may be often 
                difficult to find; nevertheless such a limit 
                always exists; and he who should pause 
                over any one subject, however minute, till he 
                had absolutely mastered it, would be as far 
                from that limit with regard to all the practical 
                ends of knowledge, as if he had suffered 
                
                *For what can be suggested in favor of the 'Man 
                    of One Book,' the reader may profitably consult the 
                    observations of Mr. D'Israeli on that subject in his 
                    'Curiosities of Literature.' There is truth in what 
                    he says; but if the proverb is to be taken at all literally, 
                    we are convinced that it has less than the 
                    usual average of proverbial wisdom, and that the 
                    'man of one book' will prove but a shallow fellow.

                his mind to dissipate itself in a vague 
                attempt at encyclopædic attainments. The 
                statement of Maclaurin on this point, expressed 
                in a characteristically mathematical 
                form, is well worthy of attention. 'Our 
                knowledge,' says he, 'is vastly greater than 
                the sum of what all its objects separately 
                could afford; and when a new object comes 
                within our reach, the addition to our knowledge 
                is the greater, the more we already 
                know; so that it increases not as the new 
                objects increase, but in a much higher proportion.'*
                At all events, it ill becomes us to speak 
                    slightingly of the various, and for all practical 
                    purposes, solid attainments of superior 
                    minds. There is a piece of self-flattery by 
                    which little minds often try to reduce great 
                    minds to their own level. 'True,' it is said, 
                    'such men have very various knowledge, but 
                    it is all superficial; they have not surrendered 
                    themselves to any one branch sufficiently;' 
                    and all this, perhaps, because they have not 
                    cultivated with the most elaborate industry 
                    every little corner of it, and because they 
                    have had some conception of the relative value 
                    of the parts of a large subject! The minute 
                    antiquary (if he be nothing more) talks 
                    in this style if he finds you ignorant of the 
                    shape of an old buckle of such a date!—
                    'You know nothing of antiquities.' The 
                    minute geographer, if he discovers that you 
                    have never heard of some obscure town at 
                    the antipodes, will tell you,—you know nothing 
                    of geography. The minute historian, 
                    if he finds that you never knew, or perhaps 
                    have known twenty times, and never cared 
                    to remember, some event utterly insignificant 
                    to all real or imaginable purposes of 
                    history,—will tell you that you know nothing 
                    of history. And yet, discerning the limits 
                    within which the several branches of knowledge 
                    should be pursued, you may after all, 
                    for all important objects, have attained a 
                    more serviceable and prompt command over 
                    those very branches in which your complacent 
                    censor flatters himself that he excels.
            But to return to the prospects of the so 
                called 'universal scholar.' There have 
                been in every age men who, gifted with gigantic 
                powers, prodigious memory, and peculiar 
                modes of arranging and retaining 
                knowledge, have aspired to a comprehensive 
                acquaintance with all the chief productions 
                of the human intellect in all time; who 
                have made extensive incursions into every 
                branch of human learning; and whose 
                knowledge has borne something like an appreciable

                ratio to the sum total of literature 
                and science; who, as Fontenelle expressively 
                    says of Leibnitz, have managed 'to 
                    drive all the sciences abreast.' Such minds 
                    have always been rare; but, as we have 
                    observed, they must soon become extinct. 
                    For what is to become of them, in after 
                    ages, as the domain of human knowledge 
                    indefinitely widens, and the creations of human 
                    genius indefinitely multiply? Not 
                    that there will not be men who will then 
                    know absolutely more, and with far greater 
                    accuracy, than their less favoured predecessors; 
                    nevertheless, their knowledge must 
                    bear a continually diminishing ratio to the 
                    sum of human science and literature; they 
                    must traverse a smaller and smaller segment 
                    of the ever widening circle! Nay, it may 
                    well be, that the accumulations of even one 
                    science (chemistry, or astronomy for instance,) 
                    may be too vast, for one brief life 
                    to master.* Or, since that thought is really 
                    too immense to be other than vague, let us 
                    confine ourselves to some very slender additions 
                    to the task of the future 'universal 
                    scholar,' imposed during the last few years. 
                    Let us think only of some few of those voluminous 
                    authors who have appeared, in our 
                    own country alone, and in the single departments 
                    of history and polite letters, 
                    within the last century, or even within two 
                    generations, and with whom not only all 
                    who pretend to profound scholarship, but all 
                    'well informed men,' are presumed to have 
                    some acquaintance;—to say nothing of living 
                    writers and the vast mass of excellent 
                    literature which they are every year pouring 
                    into the world! Let us think only of 
                    the voluminous remains of Johnson, Burke, 
                    Gibbon, Hume, Robertson, Goldsmith, Cowper, 
                    Crabbe, Byron, Walter Scott (with his 
                    
                    *'In Germany alone,' says Menzel, 'according 
                        to a moderate calculation, ten millions (?) of volumes 
                        are annually printed. As the catalogue of 
                        every Leipsig half-yearly book-fair contains the 
                        names of more than a thousand German authors, 
                        we may compute that at the present moment there 
                        are living in Germany about fifty thousand men 
                        who have written one or more books. Should that 
                        number increase at the same rate that it has hitherto 
                        done, the time will soon come when a catalogue of 
                        ancient and modern German authors will contain 
                        more names than there are living readers....In 
                        the year 1816 there were published for the first 
                        time more than three thousand books; in 1822, for 
                        the first time, above four thousand; in 1827, for 
                        the first time, above five thousand; and in 1832, 
                        for the first time, above six thousand: the numbers 
                        thus increasing one thousand every five years.'

                        Lexicon, the numbers published annually to 
                        1837, in which year they were nearly eight thousand.

                    hundred volumes), and some scores of other 
                    great names. Now as human life, it has 
                    been justly said, remains brief as ever, while 
                    its task is daily enlarging, there is no alternative 
                    but that the 'general scholar' of each 
                    succeeding age must be content with possessing 
                    a less and less fraction of the entire 
                    products of the human mind. 'Happy men,' 
                    we are half inclined ungratefully to say, 
                    'who lived when a library consisted, like 
                    that of a mediæval monastery, of some thirty 
                    or forty volumes, and who thought they 
                    knew everything when they had read these! 
                    Happy our fathers, who were not tormented 
                    with the sight of unnumbered creations of 
                    genius which we must sigh to think we can 
                    never make our own!'
            The final disposal of all this mass of literature 
                is with some easily managed. The 
                bad will perish, it is said, and the good remain. 
                The former statement is true 
                enough; the latter not so clear. 'Bad 
                books,' says Menzel, 'have their season just 
                as vermin have. They come in swarms, 
                and perish before we are aware. . . . 
                How many thousand books have gone the 
                way of all paper, or are now mouldering in 
                our libraries? Many of our books, however, 
                will not last even so long, for the paper itself 
                is as bad as its contents.' All this may be 
                true; but we cannot disguise from ourselves, 
                that not the bad writer alone is forgotten. 
                It is but too evident that immense treasures 
                of thought,—of beautiful poetry, vivacious 
                wit, ingenious argument,—which men would 
                not suffer to die if they could help it, must 
                perish too; the great spoiler here acts with 
                his accustomed partiality,—
                'Æquo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas
                Regumque turres.' . . . .
                For the truth is, that the creations of the 
                    human mind transcend its capacity to collect 
                    and preserve them; and, like the seeds 
                    of life in the vegetable world, the intellectual 
                    powers of man are so prolific that 
                    they run to waste. Some readers, perhaps, 
                    as a bright company of splendid names 
                    rushes on their recollection, may be disposed 
                    to say 'avaunt' to these melancholy 
                    forebodings. (Surely, it can be only necessary 
                    to remind them of the votive tablets in 
                    the Temple of Neptune recording escape 
                    from shipwreck. How many men have 
                        suffered shipwreck, and whose tablets therefore 
                        are not to be found! Others may think 
                    it impossible that great writers, with whom 
                    their own generation has been so familiar, 
                    and who occupy such a space in its eye, 
                    can ever dwindle into insignificance. The 
                    illusion vanishes the moment we take them 
                    
                    
                    to catalogues and indexes, and show them 
                    names of authors who once made as loud a 
                    noise in the world, of whom they never read 
                    a line. We should be too happy to believe 
                    the statement of Menzel correct: 'Of three 
                    good authors one at least will be remembered 
                    by posterity; while of a hundred bad 
                    ones, who are distinguished at present, not 
                    above one will hand down his evil example.'*
            It is with no cynical, but with simply 
                mournful, feelings that we thus dwell on the 
                mortality of the productions even of genius. 
                We would be just, both to the living and the 
                dead, by admitting that thousands of the latter 
                who are forgotten, deserved to be remembered, 
                and that the former would 
                remember them if they could. Most pleasant 
                it would be, no doubt, in case human 
                life were prolonged in some proportion with 
                the augmented sum of human knowledge,—
                to lay out our studies on a corresponding 
                scale. Possessed of antediluvian longevity, 
                we might devote some twenty years or so 
                (a year or two more or less would be of no 
                consequence) to purely elementary studies 
                and discipline; the 'promising lad' of fifty 
                might commence his more serious school 
                studies, under judicious masters, in their
                full vigour and prime of three or four centuries; 
                and at the age of ninety or a hundred, 
                the young student, just entering upon 
                life (though as yet raw and inexperienced), 
                might be supposed to have laid a tolerably 
                solid foundation, whereon in the course of 
                his progress towards manhood through the 
                next two centuries, he might, by due diligence 
                and perseverance, build such a superstructure 
                as should justify some pretensions 
                to accurate and sound scholarship. But 
                alas! we forget that, even then, the old obstructions 
                to universal knowledge would 
                soon be reproduced in a new form. The 
                same insatiable curiosity, and the same 
                restless activity, operating through longer 
                periods, would rapidly extend the circle of 
                science and literature beyond the reach of 
                even such a student. The tremendous 
                authors who enjoyed a career of five centuries 
                of popularity, would be voluminous in 
                proportion; Jeremy Taylor and Baxter, 
                Voltaire and Walter Scott would appear 
                but pamphleteers in comparison. Their

                    die Vergangenheit findet immer den gerechtesten.'

                    it is possible for the courts of criticism, like those 
                    of law, to be overdone with business; that the list 
                    may contain more causes than industry and skill 
                    can get through—except by a process which leaves 
                    justice out of the question, and dares to decide 
                    without a hearing.
                
                    154
                    The Vanity and the Glory of Literature.
                    April,
                'opera omnia' would extend to libraries. 
                Novels would be written to which the Great 
                Cyrus and Clelia would be mere novellettes; 
                wherein the heroes and heroines would be 
                married, hanged, or drowned, after a courtship 
                and adventures of two or three centuries. 
                The biographies of the long-lived 
                worthies of such an age would be composed 
                in forty folios, or more; and the history of 
                nations projected on a scale which would 
                render De Thou's huge seven tomes a mere 
                sketch or abstract. The author who began 
                the history of Athens by a dissertation on 
                the geological formation of the Acropolis, 
                or the work of Leibnitz on the house of 
                Brunswick, in which he commences with 
                his 'Protogæa,' would be but a type of the 
                prodigious gyrations of such writers; so 
                that the hopeless student, 'toiling after them 
                in vain,' would be obliged to exclaim with 
                Voltaire's 'little man of Saturn,' who only 
                lived during five hundred revolutions (or 
                fifteen thousand of our years), that scarcely 
                had he begun to pick up a little knowledge, 
                when he was summoned to depart; and that 
                to live only for such a span, is, as one may 
                say, to die as soon as one is born.
            But let us not be dismayed. The difference 
                in the position of the 'general scholar' 
                of earlier as compared with one of later 
                times, is not so vast as might at first be 
                imagined. Even the former, with all his 
                advantages, had far more books before him 
                than he could digest. We have but to look 
                at the index of their collected works, and to 
                mark the limited class of authors with 
                whom they were familiar, to be convinced 
                that each, after all, had travelled over but 
                a small portion of the entire ground. We 
                have stated that of the literature which 
                chiefly occupies each generation, the bulk, 
                even of its treasures, perishes; and as time 
                makes fresh accumulations, those of preceding 
                ages pass for the most part into quiet 
                oblivion. The process which has taken 
                effect on the past will be repeated on the 
                present age and on every subsequent one; 
                so that the period will assuredly come when 
                even the great writers of our days, who 
                seem to have such enduring claims upon 
                our gratitude and admiration, will be as 
                little remembered as others of equal genius 
                who have gone before them; when, if not 
                wholly forgotten or superseded, they will 
                exist only in fragments or specimens—these 
                fragments and specimens themselves shrinking 
                into narrower compass as time advances. 
                In this way time is perpetually 
                compiling a vast index expurgatorius; and 
                though the press more than repairs his 
                ravages on the mere matter of books, the 
                immense masses he heaps up insure the 
                
                
                purpose of oblivion just as effectually. Not 
                that his contemporary waste has ceased, or 
                become very moderate. (Probably scarcely 
                a day now passes but sees the last leaf, the 
                last tattered remnant of the last copy of 
                some work (great or small) of some author 
                or other perish by violence or accident,—by 
                fire, flood, or the crumbling of mere decay. 
                It is surely an impressive thought—this 
                silent unnoticed extinction of another product 
                of some once busy and aspiring mind!)
            Paradoxical as it may seem, the chief 
                cause of the virtual oblivion of books is no 
                longer their extinction, but the fond care 
                with which they are preserved, and their 
                immensely rapid multiplication. The press 
                is more than a match for the moth and the 
                worm, or the mouldering hand of time; yet 
                the great destroyer equally fulfils his commission, 
                by burying books under the pyramid 
                which is formed by their accumulation. 
                It is a striking example of the impotence 
                with which man struggles against the destiny 
                which awaits him and his works,—that the 
                very means he takes to insure immortality, 
                destroy it; that the very activity of the press
                —of the instrument by which he seemed to 
                have taken pledges against time and fortune
                —is that which will make him the spoil of 
                both. The books themselves may no longer 
                die; but their spirit does: and they become 
                like old men whose bodies have outlived their 
                minds,—a spectacle more piteous than death 
                itself. It is really curious to look into the 
                index of such learned writers as Jeremy 
                Taylor, Cudworth, or Leibnitz, and to see 
                the havoc which has been made on the 
                memory of the greater part of the writers 
                they cite, and who still exist, though no 
                longer to be cited; of men who were their 
                great contemporaries or immediate predecessors, 
                and who are quoted by them just as 
                Locke or Burke is quoted by us. Of scarcely 
                one in ten of these grave authorities has the 
                best informed student of our day read ten 
                pages. The very names of vast numbers 
                have all but perished; at all events have died 
                out of familiar remembrance. Let the student 
                who flatters himself that he is not ill informed, 
                glance over the index of even such a work 
                as Hallam's 'History of European Literature,'
                —designed only to record the more 
                memorable names,—and ask himself of how 
                many of the authors there mentioned he has 
                read so much as even five pages? It will 
                be enough to chastise all ordinary conceit of 
                extensive attainments, and, perhaps as effectually 
                as any thing, teach a man that truest 
                kind of knowledge—the knowledge of his 
                own ignorance.
            But while thus administering consolation 
                to the 'general scholar,' by showing that

            time has been certainly limiting as well as
                extending his task, there is another class
                who will find no consolation in the thought,
                —and that is the class of authors. There
                is no help, however: humbling as it may
                seem, to represent the higher products of
                man's mind as destined to decay, like his
                body—and the thoughts and interests which
                he knows must perish with it—it is the truth
                nevertheless, in the vast majority of instances.
                And in by far the greater number of
                the seeming instances to the contrary, authors
                still do not live; they are merely embalmed,
                and made mummies of. The works of the
                great mass of extant authors are deposited
                in libraries and museums, like the bodies of
                Egyptian kings in their pyramids—retaining
                only a grim semblance of life, amidst
                neglect, darkness, and decay.
            To Mr. D'Israeli's enthusiastic gaze, the
                sight of the rows of goodly volumes in their
                rich bindings, gleaming behind the glittering
                trellis-worktrelliswork of their carved cases, suggested
                the idea of 'eastern beauties peering through
                their jalousies!' To the eye of a severe
                philosopher they might more naturally suggest
                the idea of the aforesaid mummies.
            It has been often affirmed—and there is
                some truth in it—that of all the forms of
                celebrity which promise to gratify man's
                natural longing for immortality, there is none
                which looks so plausible as that of literary
                glory. The great statesman and warrior, it
                is said, are known only by report, and for
                even that are indebted to the poet and historian.
                Sir Walter Scott (a man by no means
                disposed to over estimateoverestimate the importance of
                a literary as compared with a practical life),
                after looking at certain drawings of some
                splendid architectural monuments of ancient
                India, the names of whose founders have
                perished, justly remarks in his diary, 'Fame
                depends on literature, not on architecture.'
                But even where a Pindar or a Tacitus undertakes
                the task of celebrating munificence
                or greatness, we are compelled to feel that
                after all it is but the conqueror's or statesman's
                portrait rather than the conqueror or
                stateman himself that is presented to us.
                On the other hand, a book is fondly presumed
                to be an author's second self; by it
                he comes as it were into contact—into personal
                communion—with the minds of his
                readers. It is a pleasant illusion no doubt;
                and in the very few instances in which the
                author does attain this permanent popularity,
                and becomes a 'household word' with posterity,
                the illusion ceases to be such, and the
                hopes of ambition are indeed splendidly realisedrealized.
                But it is not only most true that
                very few can attain this eminence; it has
                not been sufficiently observed, that as the
                
                
                world grows older, a still smaller and smaller
                portion of those who seem to have attained it
                will retain their position. A minute fraction of
                even these will be consigned to the future, and
                fractions even of these fractions will gradually
                drop away in the long march of time.
                The great mass of the writers whom 'posterity
                would not willingly let die,' if there
                were a possibility of escape, must share the
                fate of those other great men over whom the
                author is supposed to have an advantage;
                they themselves will live only by the historian's
                pen. The empty titles of their books
                will be recorded in catalogues; and a few
                lines be granted to them in biographical dictionaries,
                —with what may be truly called a
                post mortem examination of criticism; a space
                which, as those churchyards of intellect
                become more and more crowded, necessarily
                also becomes smaller and smaller, till for
                thousands, not even room for a sepulchral
                stone will be found.
            Nor is it easy to say how far this oblivion
            will go, or what luminaries will be in time
            eclipsed. Suppposing only a scantling of the
                products of the genius of each age—its
                richest and ripest fruits—handed down to
                posterity, (for there is already gathered into
                the garner, far more than any one man has
                read, or can read,) the collection of these
                scantlings gradually rise into a prodigious
                pile. The time must come when not only
                mediocrity, which has been always the
                case; not only excellence, which has been
                long the case, will stand a chance of being
                rejected, but when even gold and diamonds
                will be cast into the sieve! Hardy must
                    those be who shall then venture to hope for
                    the permanent attention of mankind! for it☜
                will be found that the greater part of authors
                have bought, not, as they fondly imagined,
                a copyhold of inheritance. Their interest
                for life or years soon runs out, and every
                year rapidly diminishes the value of the
                estate.
            We already see this mournfully realisedrealized
                in relation to a thousand bright names of the☜
                last two centuries. How much beautiful
                poetry, scarcely second in merit to any, is
                all but forgotten in the crowd, and reduced
                to a single fragment or two in some book of
                specimens or 'elegant extracts;' hardly
                more than sufficient to serve for an epitaph!
                A future, however, is approaching, when
                even volumes of specimens (to be complete)
                must be in folios, and the very abstracts of
                excellence voluminous; or, rather, when,
                if men would read only one page of each
                great genius, they must be content to construct
                a spicilegium something like that of the
                desultory student mentioned by Steele in
                one of the Guardians; who had such an

            The Vanity and the Glory of Literature.
            April,
                inordinate habit of skipping from book to 
                book, that, to gratify this taste, he fabricated 
                a volume in which each page was from a 
                different author, torn out at random, and 
                bound up together!
            With the exception, then, of the very 
                few who shine on from age to age, like 
                lights in the firmament, with undiminished 
                lustre—the Homers, the ShakspearesShakespeares, the 
                Miltons, the Bacons, enshrined, like the heroes 
                of old, among the constellations—the 
                great bulk of writers must be contented, 
                after having shone for a while, to be wholly 
                or nearly lost to the world. Entering our 
                system like comets which move in hyperbolic 
                orbits, they may strike their immediate 
                generation with a sudden splendour; but 
                receding gradually into the depths of space, 
                they will twinkle with a fainter and a fainter 
                lustre, till they fade away for ever.
            Not the least instructive of the essays of 
                Lord Jeffrey, reprinted from this journal, is 
                that suggested by Campbell's specimens of 
                the British Poets. After remarking that 
                many authors of no trivial popularity in 
                their day, occupy the smallest possible 
                amount of space in such a collection, he 
                proceeds most strikingly, but sadly, to predict 
                the possible condition of famous contemporaries 
                a century hence. 'Of near 
                two hundred and fifty authors whose works 
                are cited in these volumes, by far the greater 
                part of whom were celebrated in their generation, 
                there are not thirty who now enjoy 
                any thing that can be called popularity—
                whose works are to be found in the hands 
                of ordinary readers—in the shops of ordinary
                booksellers—or in the press for republication. 
                About fifty more may be tolerably 
                familiar to men of taste or literature: the 
                rest slumber on the shelves of collectors, 
                and are partially known to a few antiquarians 
                and scholars.' . . . . 'The last ten 
                years have produced, we think, an annual 
                supply of about ten thousand lines of good 
                staple poetry—poetry from the very first 
                hands that we can boast of—that runs quickly 
                to three or four large editions—and is as likely 
                to be permanent as present success can 
                make it. Now, if this goes on for a hundred 
                years longer, what a task will await the 
                poetical readers of 1919! . . . . Then, if 
                the future editor have any thing like the indulgence 
                and veneration for antiquity of his 
                predecessors—then shall posterity hang 
                with rapture on the half of Campbell—and 
                the fourth of Byron—and the sixth of Scott
                —and the scattered tithes of Crabbe—and 
                the three per cents. of Southey,—while 
                some good-natured critic shall sit in our 
                mouldering chair, and more than half prefer 
                them to those by whom they have been 
                
                
                superseded!' Thus does the fame which 
                looks most like immortality, resemble every 
                other form of that painted shadow; in most 
                instances it dwindles into a name; and that 
                name not always legible. 'Vanity of vanities, 
                saith the preacher; all is vanity!'*
                In one point we can hardly concur with 
                    Lord Jeffrey. He seems to think that the 
                    lot of the poet, in relation to fame, is yet 
                    more infelicitous than that of the man of science. 
                    He says, 'The fame of a poet is 
                    popular or nothing. He does not address 
                    himself, like the man of science, to the 
                    learned or those who desire to learn, but to 
                    all mankind; and his purpose being to delight 
                    and be praised, necessarily extends to 
                    all who can receive pleasure or join in 
                    applause.' Now we think it certain, that 
                    if the poet and the man of science are relatively 
                    of equal merit, the chances of being 
                    remembered are far more favourable to the 
                    former than to the latter. As we had occasion 
                    to remark some time back, in a case 
                    of no less a genius than Leibnitz: 'The 
                    condition of great philosophers is far less 
                    enviable than that of great poets. The former 
                    can never possess so large a circle of 
                    readers under any circumstances; but that 
                    number is still further abridged by the fact, 
                    that even the truths the philosopher has 
                    taught or discovered form but stepping-
                    stones in the progress of science, and are 
                    afterwards digested, systematised, and 
                    better expounded in other works composed 
                    by smaller men. The creations of poetry, 
                    on the contrary, remain ever beautiful as 
                    long as the language in which they are embodied 
                    shall endure: even to translate is to 
                    injure them. Thus it is, that for one reader 
                    of Archimedes (even amongst those who 
                    know just what Archimedes achieved,) there 
                    are a hundred thousands of readers of Homer; and of 
                    Newton it may be truly said, that nine-
                    tenths of those who are familiar with his 
                    doctrines have never studied him, except at 
                    second-hand. Far more intimate, no doubt, 
                    is that sympathy which ShakspeareShakespeare and 
                    Milton inspire; "being dead they yet speak," 
                        and may even be said to form a part of the 
                        very minds of their readers.' If comparative 
                    
                    * After penning the above words, we were 
                        reminded of another of the maxims of the same 
                        inspired writer, that there is 'nothing new under 
                        the sun;' for, in turning over old Morhof's Polyhistor 
                        for another purpose, we stumbled on the 
                        following sentence:—'Scribendorum librorum nullum 
                        esse finem jam tum sapientissimus Salomon 
                        dicebat; ac est revera res infinita; ut enim cogitationibus 
                        hominum nullus statui finis potest, ita 
                        nec libris, qui cogitationum partus sunt; quibus 
                        lectores tandem deerunt! redeuntibus semper novis 
                        qui ad temporis sui genium accommodatiores 
                        sunt, et antiquorum luminibus officiunt.'
            
            My own opinion guess is that myriads of superior works have
            been lost—superior to existing works in every department,
            except law, physics, and the exact sciences.— 1856

           neglect be the lot of the writings even
                of Newton, what must be naturally and universally
                the fate of inferior men? Of that
                treatise of Descartes, in which he lays the
                foundation of analytical geometry, how few
                of those who have pursued that science to
                heights and depths of which Descartes never
                dreamed, ever perused a syllable! The
                case of the cultivators of chemistry, and of
                many other modern sciences, is still more desperate.
                A few years obliterate all traces of
                their works; the fortune of which it is, to
                become antiquated while their authors yet
                survive—virtually obsolete, while the type
                is still fresh and the date recent. Their
                names will soon be known only in the page
                of the historian of science, who will duly
                record in a few brief lines the discoveries
                their authors made, and the still greater
                blunders they committed; will tell us that
                they were strenuous men in their day,
                and for their day did well; and that they
                are now gathered to their fathers!—Such is
                often the caput mortuum of a life of experiments!
            
            In that deluge of books with which the
                world is inundated, the lamentations, with
                which the bibliomaniac bemoans the waste
                of time and the barbarous ravages of bigotry
                and ignorance, appear at first sight somewhat
                fantastical. Yet it is not without reason
                that we mourn over many of those losses,
                especially in reference to history; and this,
                not merely as they have involved in obscurity
                some important truths, but for a reason more
                nearly related to our present subject, and
                which has seldom suggested itself. Paradoxical
                as it may seem, it may probably be
                said with truth, that the very multiplicity of
                books with which we are now perplexed, is
                in part owing to the loss of some; and that
                if we had a few volumes more, we
                should probably have had many less. The
                countless multitudes of speculations, conjectures,
                and criticisms on those ample fields
                of doubt, which the ravages of time have left
                open to interminable discussion, would then
                have been spared to us. An 'hiatus valde
                deflendus' too often leads to conjectures still
                more 'lamentable;' and a moderate 'lacuna'
                becomes the text of an immoderate disquisition.
            
            On the other hand it is doubtful whether,
                —except in the case of history,—the treasures
                of literature, of which time has
                deprived us, and the loss of which literary
                enthusiasts so bitterly regret, have been so
                inestimable. We are disposed to think
                with Gibbon, in his remarks on the burning
                of the Alexandrian library, that by far the
                greater part of the masterpieces of antiquity
                have been secured to us; and that though
                
                
                some few have assuredly been lost, there is
                no reason to believe that they have been
                numerous. The lost works, even of the
                greatest masters, were most probably inferior
                to those which have come down to us.
                Their best must have been those most admired,
                most frequently copied, most faithfully
                preserved; and therefore on all these
                accounts, the most likely to elude the hand
                of violence and the casualties of time. 'I
                sincerely regret,' says the historian, 'the
                more valuable libraries which have been
                involved in the ruin of the Roman empire:
                but when I seriously compute the lapse of
                ages, the waste of ignorance, and the calamities
                of war, our treasures rather than our
                losses are the object of my surprise. . . .
                We should gratefully remember, that the
                mischances of time and accident have
                spared the classic works to which the suffrage
                of antiquity has adjudged the first
                place of genius and glory; the teachers of
                ancient knowledge who are still extant, had
                perused and compared the writings of
                their predecessors; nor can it fairly be
                presumed that any important truth, any useful
                discovery in art or nature, has been
                snatched away from the curiosity of modern
                ages.'
            We have but to glance at our own great
                writers, to see how wide is the interval
                between their best and their worst productions.
                Is there one, at all voluminous, of
                    whom it can be said that all he has left is☜
                worthy of being transmitted to posterity?
                It is true, indeed, that once possessed of
                anything of theirs, we are naturally reluctant
                to lose it; and should even consider it
                a species of sacrilege to destroy it. Yet,
                in effect, very much they have left is as if
                it were lost—for it is never read. As in
                other cases, we neglect what we have, and
                pine for what we have not, though if we
                had it we could not use it. Are there of
                the thousands most familiar with their chief
                writings, fifty who have read all Bacon, all
                Milton, all Locke?
            We therefore acquiesce in the judgment
                of Gibbon, not only as the best consolation
                under our inevitable losses, but, as in all
                probability, the true estimate of it; not,
                however, intending thereby any apology for
                the acts which reduce us to this exercise of
                faith: neither does Gibbon. On the contrary,
                as Mr. D'Israeli says, 'he pathetically
                describes the empty library of Alexandria
                after the Christians had destroyed
                it;' while he does not in that place suggest
                any of the alleviations to which we have
                just adverted; but reserves them for the
                time when he has to describe the second
                and greater desolation on the same spot by
            
            158
            The Vanity and the Glory of Literature.
            April,
            the MahometansMuslims! On this last occasion,
                he softens somewhat of his pathos, perhaps
                of his indignation, and makes the philosophic
                estimate which we have cited. Without
                abating any of the indignation and
                contempt due to such fanatical ignorance,
                whether Christian or MahometanMuslim,—it is
                impossible, we think, to deny the sound
                sense and discrimination of the great historian's
                observations.*
                Then
                poets
                must
                arise
                to
                make
                future
                D'Israelis
                unable
                to say
                this.
                
                *'I believe that a philosopher,' says Mr. D'Israeli,
                'would consent to lose any poet to regain an
                historian.' Perhaps so; if the exchange were
                always between a Claudian and a Tacitus. But
                the latter must be great, indeed, to outweigh a
                Homer, a ShakspeareShakespeare, or a Milton. 'Fancy may
                be supplied,' he remarks, 'but truth once lost in
                the annals of mankind, leaves a chasm never to be
                filled.' We fear that the fancy of the highest
                poetry is not quite so promptly made to order;
                while, on the other hand, Niebuhr has pretty
                clearly shown that history is far from being always
                truth; not to mention that, if it were so, the highest
                creations of poetry—those of a Homer or a
                    ShakspeareShakespeare—embody truth yet more comprehensive
                
                Why the
                best
                poets
                are the
                real
                    history,
                and universal than any consigned to the page
                of history. Montaigne remarks in one of his
                essays, that the value of history does not consist in
                the bare facts it records, but in the instruction the
                facts are capable of conveying; and this is so true,
                that the parts of history which are positively fabulous
                are often more full of significance, and have
                really had more influence than the most accurate
                recital of the bare facts. Plutarch has, we suspect,
                with all his credulity and love of fable,
                really exerted more power over the minds of men
                than any of the more authentic historians of antiquity.
                The graphic account which Livy has left
                of the discordant counsels given to the Samnites
                by Herennius Pontius respecting the disposal of
                the Romans taken at the pass of Caudium, has,
                perhaps, about as much historic truth in it as any
                other of the 'thousand and one' legends which his
                historic muse (rightly so called) has seized and
                adorned; but the whole is infinitely more instructive
                and more impressive than any narrative of the
                negotiations for a surrender of prisoners of war,
                with which tame history has supplied us. That
                the fox spoke to the crane what is attributed to
                him in the fable, is very doubtful; and that some
                'nobody' killed some other 'nobody' may be very
                certain; but the fable, in the one case, is full of
                meaning, and the fact of history may be wholly
                insignificant. In our own age, honourablyhonorably distinguished
                as one of severe historic research, and
                which has produced more than one historic work,
                and one very recently, which posterity will reckon
                among its treasures, it is well that historians, while
                accurately distinguishing truth from fable, should
                neither forget the beauties nor the uses of the latter;
                nor, on the other hand, overwhelm us with
                facts, which no one cares for, and which it does
                not matter whether they happened in this way or
                that, or not at all. In the department of history
                there is no more frequent cause of that plethora of
                books under which the world is groaning. Walter
                Scott's remarks on his own Life of Napoleon are
                true in their principle, whatever we may think of
                the application of them:—'Superficial it must be,
                but I do not care for the charge. Better a superficial
                book, which brings well and strikingly together
                
                    
                Large as may be the waste of time, and
                    still larger the virtual extinction of books
                    by a silent process of oblivion, each generation
                    far more than makes up the loss;
                    and though suffering from a glut, the world
                    goes on adding to their number, as if in
                    fear of an intellectual famine. One might
                    imagine that in some departments of literature
                    there would necessarily come a pause:
                    for instance, considering there is already
                    more of first-rate poetry and fiction than
                    anybody can pretend to find time to read,
                    that none would be found to venture into
                    these fields, unless persuaded that he had
                    something to offer better than Homer,
                    ShakspeareShakespeare, or Scott! Equally prolific is
                    the literature of memoirs and biography.
                    There is a little better reason for this; yet
                    the rage for it, it must be confessed, is often
                    carried to a ludicrous extent. No sooner
                    does any man of mark or likelihood die,
                    than in addition to his life, whole volumes
                    of his letters and journals are thrust upon
                    the world.* But of all this it would be
                    as unreasonable as ungrateful to complain.
                    Fugitive as the interest of such literature
                    must be, each generation naturally wishes
                    to know more of its contemporaries than a
                    future age will condescend to learn: And
                    from almost the worst of such works some
                    casual gleam of light may illumine the
                
                the known and acknowledged facts, than a
                dull boring narrative, pausing to see farther into a
                    mill-stonemillstone every moment than the nature of the
                    mill-stonemillstone admits Nothing is so tiresome as
                walking through some beautiful scene with a
                minute philosopher, a botanist, or a pebble-gatherer,
                who is eternally calling your attention from the
                grand features of the natural picture, to look at
                grasses and chucky-stones.' If Niebuhr had given
                us, by his matchless acuteness of investigation and
                boundless learning, nothing more than the correction
                of minute dates and the true version of petty
                events, his powers would have been sadly wasted.
            *It is the same in France, in Germany, everywhere.
                'Scarce has an invitation, note, or washing-bill
                of the happy Matthison remained unprinted;
                of Jean Paul we know on what day he got his
                first braces; of Voss, what he spent in every inn
                during his little journey; of Schiller, in what
                coach he drove to visit Goethe. With such like
                trash, in short, are the many hundred volumes of
                biography and correspondence filled.'—Menzel.
                Yet even such absurdities are but the abuse of a
                reasonable wish—that of knowing celebrated men
                in their retirement and natural character. The
                details of their private life are perused, we suspect
                with greater eagerness than those of their
                public career, however splendid. It is true that
                the 'hero in these cases is as apt to vanish to the
                eyes of the reader as to the 'valet-de-chambre;'
                but the reader recognisesrecognizes what he likes better than
                a 'hero'—a man.—Still, to see great men in their
                undress, it certainly is not necessary to strip them
                stark naked. The inventory of their linen and
                their washerwoman's bills might be left sacred.

            The Vanity and the Glory of Literature.

                    page of the future historian; some fact be
                    rescued which will enable him to adjust
                    more accurately the transactions, and estimate
                    more truly the characters of the time.
                    The only doubt is whether here, as elsewhere,
                    the very copiousness of the materials
                    will not produce the same effect as the
                    dearth of them; whether the judicial sentence
                    of an historian who shall write three
                    hundred years hence, and who shall honestly
                    examine and sift his materials, will not
                    be as little to be hoped for as that of some
                    profound judges,—delayed, and still delayed,
                    till death has overtaken them amidst their
                    unresolved doubts.
            While the past is receiving into its tranquil
                depths such huge masses of literature,
                by a contrary process it is perpetually yielding
                us, perhaps nearly bulk for bulk, materials
                which it had long concealed. While
                work after work of science and history is
                daily passing away, pushed aside beyond all
                chance of republication by superior works
                of a similar kind, containing the last discoveries
                and most accurate results, it is curious
                to see with what eagerness the literary
                antiquary, in all departments, is ransacking
                the past for every fragment of unprinted
                manuscript. Many of these, if they had
                ben published when they were written,
                would have been perfectly worthless. They
                derive their sole value from the rust of age,
                just as other things derive theirs from the
                gloss of novelty. It may with truth be said
                of them, Periissent, ni periissent; unless
                they have been buried they would never
                have lived. How many societies have been
                recently formed with the laudable object of
                giving to the world what no private enterprise
                would venture to put to press. It is
                true that, judging from many of the works
                thus published, one might be inclined to
                say that some of our literary treasure-finders
                were too strongly of Justice Shallow's
                opinion, that 'things that are mouldy lack
                use.' 'It was with difficulty,' says Geoffrey
                Crayon, after describing his little antiquarian
                parson's raptures over the old drinking
                song, 'It was with difficulty the squire
                was made to comprehend that though a
                jovial song of the present day was but a foolish
                sound in the ears of wisdom, and beneath
                the notice of a learned man, yet a trowl
                written by a toss-pot several hundred years
                since was a matter worthy of the gravest
                research, and enough to set whole colleges
                by the ears.'
            But neither do we complain of all this.
            As in the case of memoirs and biographies,
            the laborious trifling of the merest drudge
            in antiquities may supply the historian with
            some collateral lights, and furnish materials
                
                
            for more vivid descriptions of the past; or,
            coming into contact with highly creative
            minds, like that of Walter Scott, may contribute
            the rude elements of hte sublimest
            or most beautiful novelties of fiction. None
            can read his novels and despise the study of
            the most trivial details of local antiquities,
            when it is seen for what beautiful textures
            they may supply the threads. It is the privilege
            of genius such as his to extract their
            gold dust out of hte most worthless books,—
            books which to others would be to the last
            degree tedious and unattractive,—and the
            felicity with which he did this was one of his
            most striking characteristics. In hundreds
            of cases it is wonderful to see how a snatch
            of an old border song, an antique phrase,
            used as he uses it, a story or fragment of a
            story from some obscure authors, shall suddenly
            be invested with an intrinsic force or
            beauty, which the original would never have
            suggested to an ordinary reader, and
            which in fact they derive, in nine instances
            out of ten, from the light of genius which
            he brought to play upon them. In those
            bright morning or evening tints even the
            barren heath or the rugged mass of grey
            stone looks picturesque; or such uses of
            antiquity remind us of the gate of the old
            Tolbooth, or fragments of the ruines of Melrose,
            incorporated with Abbotsford. The
            quality, above referred to, Mr. Lockhart has
            happily characterised. 'The lamp of his
            zeal burnt on brighter and brighter amidst
            the dust of parchments; his love and pride
            vivified whatever he hung over in these dim
            records, and patient antiquarianism, long
            brooding and meditating, became gloriously
            transmuted into the winged spirit of national
            poetry.'
            In this way minute portions of the past
            are constantly entering by new combinations
            into fresh forms of life, and out of these
            old materials, continually decomposed but
            continually recombined, scope is afforded
            for an everlasting succession of imaginative
            literature. In the same way every work of
            genius, by coming, as it were, into mesmeric
                rapport with the affinities of kindred☜
            genius, and stimulating its latent energies,
            is itself the parent of many others, and furnishes
            the materials and rudiments of ever
                new combinations.* Of more than one
                
                The greater part of those resemblances in
                thoughts and images which a carping criticism sets
                down as plagiarisms are, we are persuaded, nothing
                more than such combinations: and even of
                plagiarism, properly so called, we have as little
                doubt that the instances are far fewer than has
                generally been supposed. Many so named have
                been simply coincidences of thought, the result
                of similarly constituted minds revolving the

            The Vanity and the Glory of Literature.
            161
            of their hopes, it is well for genius to recollect
            that the doom may be indefinitely delayed
            by due care on its own part; just as,
            though nothing can avert death, a wise and
            prudent regard to health may secure a late
            termination and a green old age. Or its
            case may be compared to that of men who
            labour under some incurable chronic malady;
            it must be fatal at last—but by a due
            regimen and self-control the patient may outlive
            many of more robust health, who are
            madly negligent of the boon. It is astonishing
            what signal genius will sometimes effect
            to give permanent popularity to books, even
            in those departments in which the progress
            of knowledge soon renders them very imperfect.
            They maintain their supremacy
            notwithstanding; and their successors prolong
            their influence by means of note and
            supplement. Such will probably be the
            case with Paley's works on Natural Theology
            and the Evidences of Christianity.
            'Hume's History of England,' promises to
            be a still stronger instance, in spite not
            only of its many deficiencies, but of its
            enormous errors.
            It is, indeed, a great triumph of genius
                when it is capable of so impressing itself
                upon its productions, so moulding and shaping
                them to beauty, as to make men unwilling
                to return the gold into the melting pot,
                and work it up afresh; when it is felt that
                from the less accurate work, we after all
                learn more, and receive more vivid impressions
                than from the more correct, but less
                effective productions of an inferior artist.
                To attain this species of longevity, genius
                must not be content with being a mere mason,
                but must aspire to be an architect; it must
                seek to give preciousness to the gold and silver
                by the beauty of the cup or vase into
                which they are moulded, and to make them
                as valuable for their form as for their matter.
            The French were formerly very sensitive
                to our want of artistic skill in our literary
                composition. Indeed, Laharpe presumed to
                assert that 'Tom Jones' was the only book
                in the English language! But we may take
                comfort on comparing ourselves with the
                Germans. There is no country in Europe
                in which the mortality even of valuable
                works is so frequently the result of a
                neglect of this sort as Germany; none in
                which critics, historians, theologians, are so
                content to give to the world their crude and
                imperfect thoughts; marked indeed by a
                prodigality, but as often by an abuse of
                learning; by a command of ample materials,
                but employed without judgment,
                taste, or method. Their books in consequence
                soon give way to another fleeting
                
                generation, manufactured in the same way,
                and with as little hope of permanent popularity.
            Nor is there any country, though all are
            chargeable with the fault, to which Menzel's
            scornful remarks on 'books made out of
            books,' so strongly apply. 'Germany,' says
            he, 'is thronged with multitudes who, in
            want of any fixed employment, immediately
            begin to write books; thus reaping, as soon
            as possible, the fruits of what they have
            learned at the universities, and inundating
            the world with an immense number of crude
            and boyish works.' It is necessary only to
            inspect many German volumes to see that
            they are just the produce of a—note book;
            that the task has begun and ended in the
            carting of so much rubbish, and shooting it
            out into a bookseller's shop—where at the
            best, it may serve as a collection of materials
            for an edifice which somebody else is to
            build. Profuse reading is often their only
            characteristic; and not always is there any
            sure sign of this: for the prodigal references
            with which each page after page in many such
            works is half filled, are often slavishly copied
            from other writers, and the parade of learning
            is as empty as it is superfluous. Niebuhr
            bitterly complains of this practice;
            and justly stigmatises it as one of the dishonest
                tricks of literature. He himself☜
            tells us, and we doubt not with perfect
            truth, that he was in the habit of distinctly
            specifying all those citations which, though
            employed by him, had not occurred in the
            course of his own independent study of his
            authorities; and contends, that wherever a
            reference has been suggested by another,
            the secondary as well as the primary
            authority should be given, accompanied by
            the statement of obligation. We fear, with
            Dr. Arnold, that this remedy would not cure
            the evil; or rather that it would increase it.
            The pages of these merciless writers would
            be twice as dull from this double 'bestowment
            of their tediousness;' they would delight
            in troubling the reader with the whole
            history of each long literary chase; and
            consider a double, or, still better, a quadruple,
            array of references (though only a
            series of transcriptions), as a prouder proof
            of their erudition. What is really required
            is, that the writer should honestly endeavour
            to make his citations as few, not as
            many, as possible; and confine himself to
            the most decisive, brief, and accessible.
            As it is, the references are often such that
            scarcely three readers in ten could consult
            them, if they would—and scarcely one out of
            the three would if he could; while perhaps,
            nearly as often, the very point thus formidably
            supported, is a fact for which no

            The Vanity and the Glory of Literature.
            April,
            references are wanted at all; in which the
            authorities are the only things that require
            to be confirmed, and the proofs the only
            things that need verification. Doubtless,
            this parade of references is often employed
            for what Whately calls the 'fallacy of references;'
            —that is, in support of some
            questionable point, and in the hope 'that
            not one reader out of twenty will be at the
            pains' to verify their relevancy, or rather
            to detect their impertinence. But quite as
            often, they are used for mere ostentation.
            Those authors, whose subjects require
            them to be voluminous, will do well, if they
            would be remembered as long as possible,
            not to omit a duty, which authors in general,
            but especially modern authors, are too apt
            to neglect—that of appending to their works
            a good index. For their deplorable deficiencies
            in this respect, Professor De Morgan,
            speaking of historians, assigns the
            curious reason, 'that they think to oblige
            their readers to go through with them from
            beginning to end, by making this the only
            way of coming at the contents of their
            volumes. They are much mistaken; and
            they might learn from their own mode of
            dealing with the writings of others, how
            their own will be used in turn.'* We think
                ☞that the unwise indolence of authors has
            probably had much more to do with the
            matter, than the reasons thus humorously
            assigned; but the fact which he proceeds
            to mention is incontestably true. 'No
            writer' [of this class], says he, 'is so
            much read as the one who makes a good
            index—or so much cited.'
            Johnson, in commenting on the fate of
            books in one of the papers of the Idler, speaks
            of the necessity of an author's choosing a
            theme of enduring interest, if he would be
            remembered; and contrasts the once enormous
            popularlity of 'Hudibras' with its present
            comparative neglect. Alas! we fear that
            this is but an insufficient antiseptic. Though
            it is generally necessary, if an author would
            have even a chance of living, that he should
            take no temporary topic, he may choose the
            most enduring—and be ephemeral notwithstanding;
            and what we cannot conceal from
            ourselves is, that he may even treat his subject
            well, and yet be forgotten. But we
            suspect that this caution is of little importance.
            Such is the vigour of great genius—
            and without it nothing will be remembered
            —that where there is that, it will triumph
            over all the disadvantages of a topic of evanescent
            
            *References for the History of the Mathematical
            Sciences in the Companion to the British Almanac,

                interest. Pascal's 'Provincial Letters'
            are still read, we apprehend, quite as
            frequently as Bossuet's 'Discourse on Universal
            History,' and even 'Hudibras' a good
            deal more than Johnson's own 'Irene;' while
            the obscurities of some celebrated satire,—
            the very name of a Bufo or a Bavius,—shall
            for ages continue to provoke and baffle the
            ingenuity of the stolid commentator, who
            might just as profitably be engaged, with
            Addison's virtuoso, in the chase of butterflies
            or the collection of cockle-shells.
            If genius would attain its uttermost longevity,
            another condition it must submit to
            is, that of despising an ad captandum compliance
            with transient tastes, and the affectation
            of peculiarities for the purpose and
            in the hope of forming, as it were, a school.
            It is not to be denied that literary fashions,
            like others, may be extensive and prevalent
            for a time—but they expire with the age.
            Great genius for awhile will consecrate
            almost any eccentricities, and even acquire
            for them great temporary popularity. But
            it may well be questioned whether, where
            there is great genius and where it has
            succeeded by such artifices, it might not,
            even among its contemporaries, have gained
            equal applause at a less cost than that of
            simplicity and nature But, at all events,
            let the writer who attempts to attain fame
            by any such fantastic methods, recollect
            how ridiculous a reigning fashion looks a
            century afterwards; for not less ridiculous
            will then appear every thing that bears the
            mark of affectation and mannerism, however
            successful for a time. The Euphuism of
            Elizabeth's day is now viewed only with
            contemptuous wonder: and even Dr. Johnson,
            though he still retains a large measure
            of popularity, would have retained far more
            had it not been for his antitheses and his
            Latinisms. Addison, though nearly a century
            earlier, is still more admired, and
            without any deductions.
            It may be said, perhaps, that if in so vast
                a majority of cases the hope of immortality
                is a dream, it does not much matter how
                men write. Success, though ephemeral, is
                the great point.— To this we have, of course,
                nothing to say, except that we trust, many
                would rather not gain reputation at all,
                durable or brief, by a departure from simplicity
                and nature; and that, though immortality
                be out of the case, a gentle decay
                and serene old age have always been
                thought desirable things, rather than a
                sudden and violent dissolution. Immortality
                is not to be thought of—but euthanasia "euthanasia"
                    an easy death is
                not to be despised.
            In turning over the pages of such a book
                as the London Catalogue, one is struck,
                
            The religion of the Bible or rather of the New Testament, is a beautiful
                advanced stage in the endless never ending humanitarianism of the world—
                but as itthe Bible admits of exhaustion like the rest and is now exhausted
                it may be left to its fate on these terms: As long
                as it stands it is worthy of standing.—These are
                perhaps the true terms of all religions
            perhaps the true terms for all religions.

                amidst the apparent mutations in literature,
                with the seemingly fixed and unchanging
                influence of two portion of it—the Greek
                and Roman Classics and the BIBLE. Much
                of the literature produced by both partakes,
                no doubt, of the fate which attends other
                kinds; the books they severally elicit,
                whether critical or theological, pass away;
                but they themselves retain their hold on the
                human mind, become engrafted into the
                literature of every civilisedcivilized nation, and
                continue to evoke a never endingneverending series of
                volumes in their defencedefense, illustration, or
                explication. On a very moderate computation
                we think it may be affirmed, from
                an inspection of this catalogue, that at least
                one third of the works it contains are the
                consequence, more or less direct, of the two
                portions of literature to which we here
                refer; in the shape of new editions, translations,
                commentaries, grammars, dictionaries,
                or historical, chronological, and geographical
                illustrations.
            The old Greek and Roman Classics have
                indeed a paradoxical destiny. They cannot,
                it seems, grow old; and time, which
                'antiquates antiquity itself,' to use an
                expression of Sir Thomas Browne, still
                leaves them untouched. The ancients alone
                    Why?possessed in perfection the art of embalming
                thought. The severe taste which surrounds
                them, has operated like the pure air of Egypt
                in preserving the sculptures and paintings
                of that country; where travellerstravelers tell us
                that the traces of the chisel are often as
                sharp, and the colourscolors of the paintings as
                bright, as if the artists had quitted their
                work but yesterday.
            There is one aspect in which even the
                most utilitarian despiser of the classics can
                hardly sneer at them. From being selected
                by the unanimous suffrage of all civilisedcivilized
                nations, (the moment they become worthy
                of the name,) as an integral element in all
                liberal education, as the masters of language
                and models of taste, these venerable authors
                play, as this catalogue shows, a very important
                part even in the commercial transactions
                of mankind. It is curious to think of
                these ancient spirits furnishing no inconsiderable
                portion of the modern world with
                their daily bread; and in the employment
                they give to so many thousands of schoolmasters,
                editors, commentators, authors,
                printers and publishers, constituting a very
                positive item in the industrial activity of
                nations. A political economist, thinking
                only of his own science, should look with
                respect on the strains of Homer and Virgil;
                when he considers that, directly or indirectly,
                they have probably produced more
                material wealth than half the mines which☝
                
            
            human cupidity has opened, or half the
                inventions of the most mechanical age,—
                if we except the loom, the steam engine,
                and a few score more. It is very foolish of
                mankind, some may say, to allow them this
                varied and permanent influence. But into
                that question we need not enter. We are
                speaking as to the fact only; and shall leave
                mankind to defend themselves.
            The Bible, supposing it other than it
                pretends to be, presents us with a still more
                singular phænomenon in the space which it
                occupies throughout the continued history
                of literature. We see nothing like it; and
                it may well perplex the infidel to account
                for it. Nor need his sagacity disdain to
                enter a little more deeply into its possible
                causes, than he is usually inclined to do.
                It has not been given to any other book of
                religion, thus to triumph over national
                prejudices, and lodge itself securely in the
                heart of great communities,—varying by
                every conceivable diversity of language,
                race, manners, customs, and indeed agreeing
                in nothing but a veneration for itself. It
                adapts itself with facility to the revolutions
                of thought and feeling which shake to pieces
                all things else; and flexibly accommodates
                itself to the progress of society and the
                changes of civilisationcivilization. Even conquests—
                the disorganisationdisorganization of old nations—the
                formation of new—do not affect the continuity
                of its empire. It lays hold of the
                new as of the old, and transmigrates with
                the spirit of humanity; attracting to itself,
                by its own moral power, in all the communities
                it enters, a ceaseless intensity of
                effort for its propagation, illustration, and
                defencedefense. Other systems of religion are
                usually delicate exotics, and will not bear
                transplanting. The gods of the nations
                are local deities, and reluctantly quit their
                native soil; at all events they patronisepatronize only
                their favouritefavorite races, and perish at once
                when the tribe or nation of their worshippers
                becomes extinct, often long before. Nothing,
                indeed, is more difficult than to make
                foreigners feel any thinganything but the utmost indifference
                (except as an object of philosophic
                curiosity) about the religion of other nations;
                and no portion of their national literature is
                regarded as more tedious or unattractive
                than that which treats of their theology.
                The elegant mythologies of Greece and
                Rome made no proselytes among other
                nations, and fell hopelessly the moment they
                fell. The Koran of MahometMohammed has, it is true,
                been propagated by the sword; but it has
                been propagated by noting else; and its
                dominion has been limited to those nations
                who could not reply to that logic. If the
                Bible be false, the facility with which it
            
                The classic models, long lost or buried, then, after
                the "dark ages," fished up again and made presidential.

                from which the repining author may derive
                    consolation. One is, that, as the number of
                    readers will be perpetually increased, though
                    it may be true that the knowledge of any
                    one of them will bear an ever-diminishing
                    ratio to the absolute accumulations of human
                    science and literature, far more of both will
                    be preserved in the memories of mankind
                    collectively; and each writer, worthy to live
                    at all, will find,—not indeed temples thronged
                    with admiring worshippers and altars steaming
                    with sacrifices, but at all events a little
                    oratory here and there, where some solitary
                    devotee will be paying his homage. He
                    cannot hope to be a Jupiter Capitolinus;
                    but he may be the household god of some
                    quiet hearth—and receive there his modest
                    oblation and his pinch of daily incense.
                A still further consolation remains for
                    even those who dare not hope for so much
                    as this species of obscure fame. If not preserved
                    entire, they will yet be remembered
                    by fragments; in volumes of specimens and
                    extracts, or happier still! embalmed in those
                    vast works which will consign to posterity the
                    history of great nations; with the whole
                    story of their political, social, and intellectual
                    development. How many authors, else
                    utterly forgotten, will leave minute relics of
                    themselves in the notes and citations of such
                    works as those of Gibbon and Macaulay. It
                    is but a plank from the wreck, to be sure;
                    but it is something.
                Nor do the fond author's hopes end here.
                    We have compared the vast relics of decayed
                    and mouldering literature to the
                    animal and vegetable remains on which our
                    living world flourishes; in which it fastens
                    its roots, and over which it waves its
                    luxuriance. A fanciful mind might pursue
                    the analogy a little further, and discern
                    some resemblance between the mutations
                    and revolutions of literature and books, and
                    those incomparably greater, and yet, to us,
                    scarcely more interesting changes which
                    have swept over the surface of the material
                    world. Geologists tell us of the successive
                    submersion and elevation of vast tracts of
                    earth,—now rich in animal and vegetable
                    life,—then buried for unnumbered ages in
                    oblivion,—then again reappearing to the
                    light of day, and bearing dank and dripping
                    from the ocean bed, the memorials of their
                    past glories. It is much the same with
                    the treasures of buried literature. Long
                    whelmed beneath the inundations of barbarism,
                    or buried in the volcanic eruptions
                    of war and conquest, we see them, after
                    centuries of 'cold obstruction,' once more
                    coming to light;—the fossil remains of
                    ancient life;—forms of power, of beauty, or
                    deformity;—characterised indeed by many
                    
                    analogies to the present species of organisedorganized
                    life, but also by many differences.
            The revival of classical literature, after
                the dark ages, was the greatest and most
                splendid of these recoveries of the past;
                    and must have awakened in the minds of the
                    generation which witnessed it, emotions very
                    similar to those with which men gazed on
                    the treasures of Herculaneum and Pompeii,
                    when those ancient cities were first opened
                    to the day.
                Though this is the grandest of all such
                    restorations, let the author remember for his
                    comfort (if not too bashful), that a similar
                    process is perpetually going on, though on a
                    smaller scale. Discussions and controversies,
                    which had been hushed for ages, break out
                    again, like long silent volcanoes; men turn
                    with renewed energies to the opinions of
                    persons who had been forgotten apparently
                    for ever; and names which had not been
                    heard for centuries, once more fill men's
                    mouths and are trumpeted to the four winds.
                    A pleasantly oracular saying, or a half-
                    anticipation of some newly discovered truth,
                    is found in the voluminous writings of an
                    ancient author—and excites a passing glow
                    of veneration to his name and works. In
                    the indefatigable grubbings and gropings of
                    the literary antiquary again, scarcely any
                    authors need despair of an occasional remembrance;
                    of producing some curiosities
                    for those cabinets where the most precious
                    and most worthless of relics are preserved
                    with impartial veneration. It is hard to say
                    what his spade and mattock may not bring
                    up. What honourhonor to furnish to the Cuviers
                    of critical science, though but in a fossil
                    bone or shell, a theme for their conjectures
                    and learned dissertations; and perhaps be
                    even constructed into a more magnificent
                    creature than nature ever made the original!
                    Who could have hoped, a few years back,
                    to see the re-appearance of so much of our
                    early literature as we have recently witnessed?
                    And who could have anticipated
                    how wild a range the transient, but while
                    they last, most active fashions of literary
                    research would take? Now it is Saxon,
                    Danish, Norman antiquities;—now local
                    traditions, and old songs and ballads;—now
                    the old dramatists have their turn, and now
                    the old divines. Who could have expected
                    to see the venerable Bede's 'opera omnia'
                    in English as well as Latin, published in all
                    the glories of modern typography? 'It is
                    hard to say,' says Sir Thomas Browne,
                    speaking of our bodies, 'how often we are
                    to be buried:' the same may be said of our
                    minds; and though this successive resurrection
                    and entombment is not immortality,
                    it bears a close resemblance to transmigration

                    The Vanity and the Glory of Literature.
                    April,
                    It is true that a malicious wit
                    might hint that not a little of this exhumed
                literature is immediately re-committed to
                the dust, and that its resurrection is but for
                a second celebration of its obsequies. They
                will be inclined to say what Horace Walpole
                says of some other antiquarian recoveries,
                —'What signifies raising the dead so
                often, when they die the next minute?'
            How singular has been the destiny of
            Aristotle! After having been lost to the
            world for ages, we see him making a second
            and wider conquest, and founding the most
            Aris‑
            totledurable and absolute despotism of mind the
            world has ever seen! After a second dethronement,
            he is now fighting his way back
            to no mean empire,—an empire promising
            to be all the more permanent, that it is
            founded in a juster estimate of his real
            claims on the gratitude and reverence of
            mankind, and that he is invited to wield the
            sceptre, not of a despot, but of a constitutional
            monarch.
            But our author sighs, and says with truth
            and naïveté, 'there are so few Aristotles!'
            We reply, with a perseverance in suggesting
            consolation worthy of Boethius or Mr. Shandy,
            that, supposing none of these sedatives
            sufficient to soothe wounded vanity, there
            are still others. And among them, assuredly
            not the least, are those least thought of; we
            mean, the pleasure of composition itself;
            perhaps, after all, the greatest of an author's
            rewards: just as in so many other cases,
            happiness is found, not in the object we professedly
            seek, but in the efforts to obtain it,
            and in the energetic employment of our
            faculties. If, indeed, the experience of
            Buffon were that of authors in general, none
            would deny this, and the passion for writing
            would become a universal madness. Speaking
            of the hours of composition, he says,
            'These are the most luxurious and delightful
            moments of life; which have often enticed
            me to pass fourteen hours a day at my desk,
            in a state of transport; this gratification,
            more than glory, is my reward.'* But we
            fear that there are not a few writers, and of
            no mean fame, who, while conceding that
            when their minds wrought freely and their
            faculties lay in sunshine, the moments of
            composition were among the happiest of their
            life, would also affirm that those in which
            they have had to struggle against the vis
            inertiæ which prevented them from commencing
            their task, or had to contend with
            half-formed conceptions and intractable expressions,
            till the sun broke through the
            
            *Cited in 'Curiosities of Literature.' See the
            whole of the amusing anecdotes on Literary Composition.
            mist, and thought became clear and words
            obedient, were among the most painful.
            Well spoke one who has, we apprehend, experienced
            all the raptures and all the agonies
            of composition:—
            'When happiest Fancy has inspir'd the strains,
            How oft the malice of one luckless word
            Pursues the enthusiast to the social board,
            Haunts him, belated, on the silent plains.
            Yet he repines not, if his thought stand clear
            At last, of hinderance and obscurity,
            Fresh as the star that crowns the brow of morn.'
            We are inclined to place the pleasure of
            writing itself, among the chief incentives of
            authorship; and the proof is found in this,
            that so few ever stop when they have once
            begun,—not even for neglect or poverty.
            'There are millions of men,' says Byron,
            'who have never written a book, but few
            who have written only one.' And Walter
            Scott's testimony to the inveteracy of the
            cacoethes scribendi is equally strong. Not
            even the ointment of sarcasm and satire can
            cure it.
            Perhaps even this will not be taken as
            sufficient compensation: why then let the
            author remember that in the only intelligible
            sense, he enjoys almost as extensive a fame
            as his betters. There is a little circle of
            which each man is the centre; and this
            narrow theatre is generally enough for the
            accommodating vanity of hte human heart.
            Indeed, it is of that microcosm in which each
            man dwells, that even the loftiest ambition is
            really thinking, when it whispers to itself
            some folly about distant regions and remote
            ages, whose unheard plaudits will never
            greet his ear, and which he utterly fails to
            realise. It is, after all, the applause of the
            familiar friends, among whom he daily lives,
            that he craves and loves. It may be doubted
            whether Musæus was ever so delighted
            with the thought of posthumous renown, as
            he was when his little boy, discovering from
            an upstairs window a fresh troop of visitors
            coming, as the child supposed, with the usual
            offering of congratulations on his father's
            sudden success, cried out, 'Here are more
            people coming to praise papa!'
            Should our friends and family form too
            small a sphere for the vaulting ambition of
            self-love, we must needs content ourselves
            with the questionable comfort suggested in
            the case of our literal death, not only by
            Cicero and his imitator Mr. Shandy, but by
            all other consolers, from the time of Job's
            comforters downwards;—that it is the 'common
            lot,' and that 'what is the doom of our
            betters is good enough for us.' Nor will
            vanity fail to whisper, 'Not the worthless
            alone are forgotten,—gold, silver, pearls,
            
                1849.

                and jewels strew the bottom of the ocean.
                It is not the will of man, but the law of nature,
                that I should die.'
            In truth, for an honest man, the single
                sentence already quoted from Pliny will be
                consolation enough. LIke every other honest
                man who does his duty to the present
                hour, and who dreams not of asking immortality
                for his merits, it will be sufficient
                to the writer, to have 'served his generation.'
                Nor need we say, in how important
                a degree each individual has done this!
                It is a topic easily improved upon, by the
                happy facility of human vanity; for all are
                ready enough to believe—and certainly authors
                as much as any—that they have not
                trifled life away; and to think of their doings
                much as Uncle Toby did of his mimic fortifications:
                'Heaven is my witness, brother
                Shandy, that the pleasure I have taken in
                these things, and the infinite delight in particular,
                which has attended my sieges in my
                bowling-green, has arose within me, and I
                hope in the Corporal too, from the consciousness
                we both had, that in carrying them on
                we were answering the great ends of our
                creation.'
            But, without a gibe, the destiny of the
            honest writer, even though but moderately
            successful, and much more if long and
            widely popular, is surely glorious and enviable.
            It may be true that he is to die,—for
            we do not count the record of a name when
            the works are no longer read as anything
            better than an epitaph, and even that may
            vanish; yet, to come into contact with other
            minds, even though for limited periods,—to
            move them by a silent influence—to cooperate
            in the construction of character—to
            mould their habits of thought—to promote
            the dominion of truth and virtue—to exercise
            a spell over those we have never seen
            and never can see,—in other climes,—at
            the extremity of the globe,—and when the
            hand that wrote is still for ever,—is surely a
            most wonderful and even awful prerogative.
            It comes nearer to the idea of the immediate
            influence of spirit on spirit than anything
            else which this world presents us. It
            is of a purely moral nature; it is also silent
            as the dew—invisible as the wind! We
            can adequately conceive of such an influence
            only by imagining ourselves, under
            the privilege of the ring of Gyges, to gaze,
            invisible, on the solitary reader as he pores
            over a favourite author, and watch in his
            countenance, as in a mirror, the reflection
            of the page which holds him captive; now
            knitting his brow over a difficult argument,
            and deriving at once discipline and knowledge
            by the effort,—now relaxing his
            smiles at wit and humour—now dwelling
            je jes
            
            
            with a glistening eye on tenderness and
            pathos—and in either case the subject of
            emotions which not only constitute the mood
            of the moment, but in their measure cooperate
            to the formation of those habits which
            issue in character and conduct; now yielding
            up some fond illusion to the force of
            truth, and anon betrayed into another by
            the force of sophistry; now rebuked for
            some vice or folly, and binding himself with
            renewed vows to the service of virtue; and
            now sympathizing with the too faithful delineation
            of vicious passions and depraved
            pleasures, and strengthening by one more
            rivet the dominion of evil over the soul!
            Surely, to be able to wield such a power as
            this implies, in any degree and for limited
            periods, is a stupendous attribute; one
            which, if more deeply pondered, would
            frequently cause a writer to pause and
            tremble, as though his pen had been the rod
            of an enchanter.
            Happy those who have wielded it well,
            and who
            'Dying leave no line they wish to blot.'
            Happier, far happier such, in the prospect
            of speedy extinction, than those whose loftier
            genius promises immortality of fame, and
            whose abuse of it renders that immortality a
            curse. Melancholy indeed is the lot of all,
            whose high endowments have been worse
            than wasted; who have left to that world
            which they were born to bless, only a legacy
            of shame and sorrow; whose vices and
            follies, unlike those of other men, are not
            permitted to die with them, but continue active
            for evil after the men themselves are
            dust.
            It becomes every one who aspires to be a
                writer to remember this. The ill which
                other mendo, for the most part dies with
                them. Not indeed that this is literally true,
                even of the obscurest of the species. We
                are all but links in a vast chain which
                stretches from the dawn of time to the consummation
                of all things, and unconsciously
                receive and transmit a subtle influence.
                As we are, in great measure, what our forefathers
                made us, so our posterity will be
                what we make them; and it is a thought
                which may well make us both proud and
                afraid of our destiny.
            But such truths, though universally applicable,
                are more worthy of being pondered
                by great authors than by any other class of
                men. These outlive their age; and their
                thoughts continue to operate immediately on
                the spirit of their race. How sad, to one
                who feels that he has abused his high trust,
                to know that he has to perpetuate his vices;
                that he has spoken a spell for evil, and cannot

            unsay it; that the poisoned shaft has
            left the bow and cannot be recalled. If we
            might be permitted to imagine for a moment
            that it is a part of the reward or punishment
            of departed spirits, to revisit this lower
            world and to trace the good or evil consequences
            of their actions, what more deplorable
            condition can be conceived than that of
            a great but misguided genius, taught, before
            he departed, the folly of his course, and condemned
            to witness its effects without the
            power of arresting them? How would he
            sigh for that day which shall cover his fame
            with a welcome cloud, and bury him in the
            once dreaded oblivion! How would he
            covet as the highest boon the loss of that
            immortality for which he toiled so much and
            so long! With what feelings would he see
            the productions of his wit and fancy, proscribed
            and loathed by every man whose
            love and veneration are worth possessing.
            With what anguish would he see the subtle
            poison he had distilled take hold of innocence;
            watch the first blushes of still ingenuous
            shame, see them fade away from the
            cheek as evil became familiar, triace in his
            influence the initial movements in that long
            career of agony and remorse and shame
            which awaits his victims; and shudder to
            think that those whose faith he has destroyed,
            or whose morals he has corrupted, may find
            him out in the world of spirits, to tax him
            as their seducer to infamy and crime!*
            Even such authors, however, will reach
            the oblivion they have desired at last; for
            this must be the ultimate doom (whatever
            might otherwise have been the case) of all
            who have set at defiance the maxims of decency,
            morality, and religion,—however
            bright their genius, and however vast their
            powers. As the world grows older, and,
            we trust, better—as it approximates to that
            state of religious and moral elevation which
            Christianity warrants us to anticipate, many
            
            *To see this matter in its true light must, we
            fear, be left to the more unclouded vision of another
            world. Literary vanity is almost the last
            foible that is surrendered in this. There is much
            knowledge of human nature, as well as keen satire,
            in the tale which Addison tells of the atheist, who,
            bewailing on his death-bed the mischief his works
            would do after he was gone, quickly repented of
            his repentance, and which his spiritual adviser unhappily
            sought to alleviate his grief by assuring him
            that his arguments were so weak, and his writings
            so little known, that he need not be 
            hensions. 'The d

                heart with these
                swering the good
                had picked up s
                they thought him

            a production which a licentious age has pardoned
            for its genius, will be thrown aside in
            spite of it. In that day, if genius rebelliously
            refuse, as it assuredly will not—for
            the highest genius has not even hitherto refused
            —to consecrate itself to goodness, the
            world will rather turn to the humblest productions
            which are instinct with virtue, than
            to the fairest works of genius when polluted
            by vice. In a word, the long idolatry of intellect
            which has enslaved the world will be
            broken; and that world will perceive that,
            bright as genius may be, virtue is brighter
            still.
            Happy the writers who, if destined to live
            so long, have, with souls prophetic of the
            great change, and true to the dictates of
            morality and religion, never written a line
            but what after-ages may gratefully turn to
            for solid instruction or innocent delight; and
            happy also all who, though not destined to
            see those distant times, have in any measure
            contributed to form and hasten them!
            Plato, in a well-known passage of his
            Phædrus, describes Socrates as contending
            for the superiority of oral instruction, by representing
            books as silent. The inferiority
            of the written word to the living voice is in
            many respects undeniable; but surely it is
            more than compensated by the advantage of
            its diffusive and permanent character. Great
            as has been the influence of Socrates, he
            owes it almost entirely to the books he refused
            to write! and it might have been
            greater still, had he condescended to write
            some of his own.
            But the chief glory of all human literature
            —taking it collectively—is, that it is
            our pledge and security against the retrogradation
            of humanity; the effectual breakwater
            against barbarism; the ratchet in the
            great wheel of the world, which, even if it
            stands still, prevents it from slipping back.
            Ephemeral as man's books are, they are at
            least not so ephemeral as himself; and consign
            without difficulty to posterity what
            would otherwise never reach them. A good
            book is the Methuselah of these latter ages.
            We must conclude, however, lest we
            should have reason to apply to ourselves the
            words of old Fuller: 'But what do I, speaking
            against multiplicity of books in this age,
            who trespass in this nature myself? What
            was learned man's compliment, may serve
            for my confession and conclusion. Multi
            rant—ut cùm
                endo temperare

                anity' without

                            SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY.—In a more extended sense, it is used to
                            comprehend the whole development of philosophy of Greece from Socrates to
                            the Neo Platonists. The title is so far just, as all the schools of this period,
                            with the single exception of the Epicurean, called themselves by the name of
                            Socrates, and arrogated to themselves the merit of exclusively propagating
                            the true doctrines of Socrates. But in a narrow and more proper signification,
                            it signifies the peculiar direction and method which Socrates gave to
                            philosophical inquiry. The Socratic method of reasoning and instruction was
                            by interrogatories. Instead of laying down a proposition authoritatively, this
                            method led the antagonist or disciple to acknowledge it himself by dint of a
                            series of questions put to him. It was not hte object of Socrates to establish
                            any perfectly evolved system of doctrine, so much as to awaken by his discourses
                            a new and more comprehensive pursuit of science, which should direct
                            itself to all that is knowable. To him is ascribed two of the very first principles
                            of science, namely, the inductive method and the definition of ideas.
