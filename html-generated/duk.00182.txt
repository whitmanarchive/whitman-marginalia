                The Social Contract, Or; Principles of Right.
                    Foederis Aequas
                    Dicamus leges  Virgil, Æneid, 11, 324.
                    
                    Preface, prefixed to the First Edition
                    This little Treatise is extracted from a more extensive
                    work, undertaken without consulting my resources,
                    and long since abandoned.—The following comprises
                    the greater part of the different fragments which
                    had been written, and which seemed to me best
                    worthy; all else destroyed.—
                    (1.) Montesquieu has only spoken of positive laws,
                    leaving his splendid structure incomplete; but we must
                    go to the very source of these laws, to trace the
                    origin of this primitive implied or expressed Covenant
                    which binds all societies together.—The Contrat Social
                    has appeared; this forms the portico of the temple,
                    and the first chapter of L'Esprit des lois.—We may
                    say in truth of this author—"The Human Race had
                    Lost its Title Deeds—Jean JaquesJacques has found Them."
                    (Note by Brissard.)
                    Rousseau has given the substance of
                    his Contrat Social in the fifth book of Emile,
                    where traveling is discussed; and another abstract
                    is given in Lettres de la Montagne, (letter Sixth)
            
                    Book First.2
                        I wish to inquire whether, taking men as they
                        are, and laws as they may be made, some just rule
                        of administration may not be established in the
                        civil order.—In this research it will be my
                        constant endeavor to ally that which the 
                        right permits, with that which policy prescribes,
                        that justice and interest may not be divided.—
                        I begin without expatiating.—I may be
                        asked Who I am—a prince? a lawgiver?—No,
                        neither; and therefore it is I write.—Born a 
                        citizen of a free state, and member of its sovereignty,
                        Chapter First,—Subject
                        Man is born free, yet he is everywhere
                        in fetters.—He who fancies himself the master
                        of others is only more enslaved than they.—
                        Whence this anomaly?—I know not its cause.—
                        What can legalize it?—I think I can answer.
                        Did I only consider force, and the results arising
                        from it, I should say,: So long as a nation
                        is constrained to obey, and does obey, it does acts
                        well; So soon as ait is able to throw off
                        the yoke, and does throw it off, it acts
                        still better;—for, as it regains its liberty by
                        the same right which deprived it of liberty.
                        For all this, social order is a sacred right
                        upon which all others are based.—This right,
                        however, originates not in nature, but is founded
                        on covenants.—Now to investigate those covenants. 
            
             
                     Chapter 2d (3
                        The first Societies.
                         Family organization is the oldest society
                         and the only natural one.—Yet children only
                         remain subject to the father, while they need his care.
                         Then Afterward both father and children resume their
                         independence; each is free from the other.—If
                         they still remain united it is because they
                         voluntarily elect to do so.—This common liberty
                         is a consequence of the nature of man.—
                         His first law is that of watching over his own
                         preservation.—Subsequently, the chief is the symbol
                         of the father,—the people, of the children,—; and 
                         all being born free and equal, none can alienate
                         their liberty except for their own interests.—The 
                         sole difference is, that in the family the love of the 
                         father for the children compensates him for the 
                         cares he bestows, 
                         (orig.?
                         —Is it not also that the like care was
                         aforetime bestowed upon him—and
                         now he only pays?)
                         —while, in the State
                         the Ruler is compensated by the honor and profit
                         of ruling?—.—
                         Grotius denies that all human rights? 
                         can be established in favor of the governed,
                         citing slavery as an example.—His constant
                         manner of reasoning is to establish the right
                         by the deed.—(1) A more logical method may be used—but less
                         favorable to tyrants.—
                         
                         —(1.) The ablest researches into public rights often simply
                         consist of the history of past abuses, and we bewilder our-
                         selvesourselves to no purpose when we take the pains to study
                         them deeply.—(Traite des Interests, France; Marquis Argenson.)—This 
                         is precisely what Grotius has done.—
                         
             
                         4
                     It is doubtful, according to Grotius, whether
                         the human race belongs to a hundred men, or 
                         these hundred men belong to the human race;
                         and but he seems inclined to the first opinion.—
                         This is also the sentiment of Hobbes.—See the
                         human species thus divided into herds of cattle,
                         each having its chief, who guards but to devour
                         it.—As a shepherd is by nature superior to his
                         flock, so the human shepherds.—Thus reasoned
                         the Emperor Caligula, according to Philon, proving
                         plausibly enough that the kings were gods, or
                         the people beasts.—
                         The philosophy of Caligula is revived in
                         that of Hobbes and Grotius.—Aristotle had
                         said, before them all, that men are not
                         equal by nature, but that some were born
                         for slavery, and some for dominion.—Aristotle
                         was right, but he mistook the effect for the cause.
                         Every man that is born in slavery is born for
                         slavery; nothing is more certain.—Slaves lose
                         everything in their fetters; even to the desire
                         of quitting them; they love their servitude, as
                         the companions of Ulysses loved their brutishness.
                         If there are slaves by nature, it is because
                         there have been slaves against nature.—Force
                         made the first slavery; cowardice has per-
                         petuatedperpetuated it.
                         I have said nothing of King Adam, or the Emperor
                         Noah, the father of the three great monarchs who
                         divided the universe, like the children of Saturn,
                         whom we seem to recognize in them.—
            
             
            5th
                         Chapter 3d
                         The Right of the Strongest
                         The strongest man can never be strong enough
                         to be always master, unless he transforms force
                         into right, and obedience into duty.—From
                         this arises the right of the strongest, a right
                         which is seemingly claimed in irony, but really
                         laid down as a principle.—But will they not
                         define this word for us?—Force is a physical
                         power; I cannot see what morality can result 
                         from its effects.—To yield to force is an act
                         of necessity, not will.—At the most it is an
                         act of prudence.—In what sense can this
                         be a duty?—
                         Let us assume this pretended right for a 
                         moment.—Nothing but inexplicable nonsense
                         results from it; as the effect changes with
                         the cause, and every force which surmounts
                         the first one, succeeds in right.—So long as
                         we can disobey successfully, we do so lawfully;
                         and, if the strongest is in the right, the only
                         point is to prove who may be the strongest.
                         Of what avail is a right which perishes when
                         force ceases?—If we must obey by force, of
                         what need is duty?
                         "Submit yourselves to the higher powers."
                         If this means, yield to force, the precept is a 
                         good one, but superfluous.—I answer that it
                         will never be violated.—All power comes
                             
             
                             6
                         from God, but all sickness comes from Him
                         also.—Are we therefore to conclude that we
                         are forbidden to call the physician?—When a 
                         robber surprises me in a forest, I must 
                         surrender my purse to force,—but when I can
                         regain it, am I obliged by conscience to give 
                         it to him?
                         We admit then, that force does not constitute
                         right and that we are only obliged to obey the
                         legitimate powers.—My first question returns.
                         Chapter 4th.
                         Since no man possesses a natural authority
                         over his fellows, and since force does not produce
                         any right, covenants therefore remain as the basis
                         of all legitimate authority among men.
                         "If a private citizen," says Grotius, "has a
                         right to alienate and cede himself as a slave to a master,
                         why have not a whole nation an equal right?"
                         There are equivocal words here, but we will
                         confine ourselves to alienate—that is to give, or
                         sell.— X X X X
                         But if each individual could alienate
                         himself, he could not alienate his children,
                         and theirs, and theirs.—
                         (that's the strongest point.)
                         X X X X X X X
                         (This chapter is to prove that the right of
                         Slavery, either through cession, victory, sparing life,
                         or what not, is null.—)—He says "The words Slavery
                         and right are contradictory,—
                         each excludes the other."
            
             
            7
                         Chapter Fifth
                         We must always refer to a first Convention.—
                         Should I grant all the positions which I have just
                         refuted, the advocates of despotism would not be
                         benefited thereby—there will ever be a wide difference
                         between subduing a multitude, and governing a nation.
                         Uncivilized men enslaved men and their masters,

                         there is no commonwealth.

                         I will suppose that men have reached that crisis
                         where the difficulties that threaten their preservation in 
                         a state of nature, exceed their resources in that state.
                         They perish then unless they improve that state.
                         Now men cannot create new forces, but they can
                         unite and direct those which already exist—they
                         can associate, under a representative head, or
                         something like several heads.—
                         This union involves all,—yet how can
                         each pledge his strength and liberty, without
                         injuring his interests? X X X
                         Given: To find a system of association
                         which shall defend and protect with the whole
                         common force the person and property of each

                         with all, shall be subject only to himself, thus remaining
                         as free as before the union.—This is the organic
                         problem, the solution of which is given by the

                         change in man by substituting in his conduct

                         his actions—It is first at this point that,

                     Although in this state he yields some
                         of his natural advantages, he gains others,
                         more important—and his faculties exercise and
                         developedevelop themselves, his ideas become enlarged,
                         his sentiments ennobled, and his whole being
                         is elevated to such a degree, that although
                         abuses of this new condition may often
                         degrade him beneath the state which he
                         has quitted, he should unceasingly bless the
                         happy moment which rescued him from
                         it,—and which, from a stupid and insignificant
                         animal, created an intelligent being and a man!
                         Let us reduce this balance of advantages
                         to terms easy of comparison:. Man's loss
                         by the social contract is his natural liberty,
                         and an unlimited right to all that he may have
                         the power to wrest or acquire—His gain is
                         civil liberty, and protection in the ownership
                         of what he earns or possesses.—

                         We may also add, as gain, moral liberty
                         which alone renders man truly master of
                         himself—for obedience to lower appetites is

                     I shall terminate this by book by a 
                         remark upon which every social system
                         should be based—namely—That instead of
                         destroying natural equality, the social compact,
                         on the contrary, substitutingtes a civil and
                         legitimate equality for the physical inequality
                         that nature has caused among men,—and
                         That, however unequal they may be in respect
                         to strength or genius, all become equalized
                         by strength, and by right.—
                         Note.—Under bad governments, this equality is
                         but seeming and illusory, serving only to maintain
                         the poor in their misery and the rich in
                         their usurpations.—In this case the laws
                         are always advantageous to the possessors,
                         and injurious to non-possessors.—from
                         which it follows that the social state 
                         can only be beneficial to men when 
                         all possess some, but none too much,
                         property.—
                         orig.—Or rather when all have opened to
                         them an equal right to the avenues
