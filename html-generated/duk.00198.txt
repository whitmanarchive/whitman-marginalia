            Egyptian 
                religion
            
            existing 
            in nascence 
            or developementdevelopment 
            through many 
            thousand years 
            five, or ten, 
            or perhaps even 
            twice ten 
            thousand years
            
            The central idea seems 
            to have been the 
            wonderfulness and divinity 
            of Life,. exemplified 
                in any object, a The be 
            beetle, a the bull, athe 
            snipe were divine in that they exemplified the inexplicable mystery of life.—It was a pro‑profound 
            found and exquisite 
            religion
            Greek 
            existing 
            through 
            several 
            thousand 
            years— 
            certainly 
            th two 
            thousand 
            —very likely 
            several more
            
            Central idea, a combination 
            of Love, Intellect, and 
            the Esthetic, (the beautiful 
            and harmonious,)—A 
            rRefined perceptions, the 
            presence of perfect human 
            bodies, the climate, the 
            singular developed peculiar adhesiveness or friendship of 
            the people, all are in the 
            Greek mythology
            
            Hebrew
            The most ethereal and elevated 
            Spirituality—this seems to be 
            the what subordinates all the 
            rest—The soul—the spirit— 
            rising in vagueness—
