            appearance of the Minnepoesy. It would
                seem as it the influence of Austria had
                always been hostile to everything beautiful
                and free. From Johann Hadloub,
                one of the last of the Minnesingers, we
                take this pleasing and characteristic song.
                The translation is by Edgar Taylor.
                "I saw yon infant in her arms caressed,
                    And as I gazed on her my pulse beat
                    high:
                Gently she clasped it to her snowy breast,
                While I, in rapture lost, stood musing by:
                Then her white hands around his neck she
                flung,
                And pressed it to her lips, and tenderly
                Kissed his fair cheek, as o'er the babe she
                hung.
            And he, that happy infant, threw his arms
                Around her neck, imprinting many a
                kiss;
                Joying, as I would joy, to see such charms,
                As though he knew how blest a lot were
                his.
                How could I gaze on him and not repine?
                'Alas!' I cried, 'would that I shared the
                bliss
                Of that embrace, and that such joy were
                mine!'
                
                Straight she was gone; and then that lovely
                    child
                Ran joyfully to meet my warm embrace:
                Then fancy with fond thoughts my soul beguiled;—
                    It was herself! O dream of love and
                    grace!
                    I clasped it, where her gentle hands had
                    pressed,
                    I kissed each spot which bore her lips'
                    sweet trace,
                    And joy the while went bounding through
                    my breast."
                Germany, like Greece, has her tales
                    and legends of a heroic age. The Heldenbuch
                    and the Nibelungenlied, like the
                    Iliad and Odyssey, serve as grand repositories
                    of ancient national traditions. Of
                    these, the Heldenbuch is a collection of
                        pieces by various authors, and differing
                        widely in character and merit. The Nibelungenlied,
                            on the other hand, is a true
                            epic, with perfect unity of plot and action,
                            advancing with ever-increasing interest to
                            the bloody catastrophe in which it terminates.
                    It is curious to survey the world
                    which these ancient poems open to our
                    view—definite, populous, active, teeming
                    with life and motion. In their palace at
                    Worms, upon the Rhine, we see the royal
                    brothers, Günther, Ghernot, and Ghiseler
                    the young. Round them stand their
                    chosen blades, the champions of the Burgundian
                    people, Dankwart, Ortwin, Volker,
                    the fiddler-warrior, and, towering
                    above all his peers, the fearful Von
                    Tronek Hagen, dauntless, unscrupulous,
                    vengeful and remorseless. Far away, in
                    the land of the Nibelungen, situate in
                    some undiscovered region of earth,
                    shrouded perhaps by the mist and fog
                    (nebel) from which its name might seem
                    to be derived, dwells the gay and gallant
                    Siegfried, the Achilles of this Germannebel, (fog)

                    the Lombard warriors, Dietrich, Hildebrand,
                    Ilsan, and others, who show
                    themselves in no wise inferior to the
                    bravest of the Burgundians. Eastward,Nibeleidungen

                    figures of this Epic cycle, the two

                    and imperious—and Chrimhild, beautiful
                    and gentle, but driven by repeated injuries
                    into diabolical rancor—whose hostile
                    collision brings about the catastrophe
                    that desolates this heroic world.JMastersinger

                These poems, at least in their present
                    form, were in great part the productions
                    of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.
                    Up to this time, the poetry of the Germans
                    might safely challenge comparison
                    with that of any other European nation.
                    But the promise of its spring was not to
                    be realized. A period followed of corruption
                    and decline. During the fifteenth
                    and sixteenth centuries, flourished the
                        Mastersingers, who made poetry a mere
                        handicraft. Meanwhile, the vigorous
                    minds of Germany were occupied with
                    other matters. They had to invent the
                    art of printing; to commence and carry
                    on the Reformation; to fight for civil and
                    religious freedom. The struggle for libertyHeldenbuch

                    was long and doubtful. After many
                    partial encounters came the great decisive
                    conflict in the first half of the seventeenth
                    century. For thirty years the torrent of
                    war rolled hither and thither over the
                    soil of Germany. Freedom triumphed;
                    but the country was exhausted, physically
                    and intellectually. It was not until
                    the commencement of the last century
                    that the spirit of German poetry began to
                    revive. Things grow better by slow degrees.
                    A period of utter barrenness is
                    followed by a period of moderate fertility.
                    The interval between the years 1700 and
                    1750 is the age of mediocrities. It is the
                    age of Bodmer, Hagedorn, Gellert, Gleim
                    and Ramler. But just at the middle of

                        and sublime, intensely patriotic and
                        religious, with a genius for the epic and
                        the lyrical—Lessing, unrivaled as a
                        critic, at once subtle and strong, discerning
                    truth by intuitive perception, and
                    combating error with matchless skill and
                    success. These men were followed, in
                    quick succession, by the great names of
                    German poetry, Wieland, Herder, Goethe
                    and Schiller.
                From Goethe and Schiller Mr. Longfellow
                    has taken but little; thinking, no
                    doubt, that all readers of poetry must be
                    familiar with authors so often talked of,
                    and so much translated. His extracts
                    from Goethe are introduced by a series of
                    sketches, descriptive and critical, selected
                    from different writers. The good-natured
                    Gleim informs us, how he was himself
                    reading the Musen-Almanach to a literary
                    circle at Weimar, when "a young
                    man, booted and spurred, in a short green
                    shooting-jacket, thrown open," enters
                    the room, and after listening a while,
                    "offers to relieve him, from time to time,
                    in reading aloud, lest he should be tired."
                    Accordingly, he takes up the book, and
                    at first all goes on swimmingly. "But
                    on a sudden, it was as as if some wild
                    and wanton devil had taken possession
                    of the young reader, and I thought I saw
                    the Wild Huntsman bodily before me.
                    He read poems that had no existence in
                    the Almanach; he broke out into all
                    possible modes and dialects. Hexameters,
                    iambics, doggerel verses, one after another,
                    or blended in strange confusion,
                    came tumbling out in torrents." He does
                    not spare even the worthy Gleim. "But
                    in a little fable, composed extempore in
                    doggerel verses, he likened me, wittily
                    enough, to a worthy and most enduring
                    turkey-hen, that sits on a great heap of
                    eggs of her own and other people's, and
                    hatches them with infinite patience; but
                    to whom it sometimes happens to have a
                    chalk egg put under her instead of a real
                    one; a trick at which she takes no offence."
                
                Then we have Hauff telling how he introduced
                    a young American to the great
                    poet, who hastened to relieve the anxiety
                    of his visitor by inquiring about the
                    weather in America. "The countenance
                    of the young man began to brighten up,
                    the sluices of his eloquence were soon
                    opened, and he talked about the Canadian
                    mists, about the spring-storms of New
                    York, and praised the umbrellas which
                    are manufactured in Franklin-street, Philadelphia."
                
                Bettine describes her first interview
                with Goethe, not omitting to mention
                how she threw herself upon his neck and
                fell asleep in his lap; conduct which
                scarcely accords with our ideas of feminine
                propriety, though to condemn it, as
                some have done, as if it were indecent
                and infamous, is wholly to mistake the
                character of the parties and their relation
                to each other.
                Börne urges against Goethe the oft-repeated
                charge of utter want of patriotism.
                The defencedefense, which the poet was accustomed
                to set up on his own behalf, we
                find in his Conversations with Eckermann.
                "If a poet," he says, "has employed
                himself during a long life in combating
                pernicious prejudices, overcoming
                narrow views, elevating the intellect, and
                purifying the taste of his country, what
                could he possibly do better than this?
                How could he be more patriotic?" He
                protests against "all intermeddling with
                subjects that one does not understand;"
                and declares that "of all intermeddling
                bunglers, political bunglers are to him the
                most odious, for their handiwork involves
                thousands and millions in destruction."
                He says farther, "that he has uniformly
                refused to mix himself up with party politics:"
                as if the subjugation of his native
                country by a foreign despot, and its
                liberation by the enthusiastic movement
                of the whole German people, were mere
                issues of party politics, to which a literary
                man might be wholly indifferent.
                The cardinal doctrine of the Goethean
                philosophy, that an artist may live in art
                alone, may hold himself aloof from the
                world of action, neglect the momentous
                questions that agitate society, refuse to
                take part by word or deed in the great
                events that are going on round him, is a
                doctrine which could not well be entertained
                by any but a cold and selfish
                spirit.
                Menzel, in his powerful review of
                Goethe's personal and literary character,
                finds the essence of his poetry as of his
                life to be egotism: "not, however, the
                egotism of the hero and the heaven storming
                Titan, but only that of the Sybarite
                and the actor, the egotism of the passion
                for pleasure and the vanity of arts."
                This Epicurean devotion to selfish enjoyment,
                and indifference to the great objects
                of life, are well expressed in the following
                song, which shows at least that its author

                could comprehend these feelings perfectly,

                I've set my heart upon nothing, you see;
                    Hurrah! 
                    And so the world goes well with me.
                    Hurrah!
                    And who has a mind to be fellow of mine,
                    Why, let him take hold and help me drain
                    These mouldy lees of wine.
                    I set my heart at first upon wealth;
                    Hurrah!
                    And bartered away my peace and health;
                    But, ah!
                    The slippery change went about like air;
                        And when I had clutched me a handful
                        Away it went there.[here,
                I set my heart upon woman next;
                    Hurrah! 
                    For her sweet sake was oft perplexed; 
                    But, ah!
                    The false one looked for a daintier lot,
                    The constant one wearied me out and out,
                    The best was not easily got.
                I set my heart upon travels grand,
                    Hurrah! 
                    And spurned our plain old fatherland;
                    But, ah! 
                    Nought seemed to be just the thing it 
                    should,
                    Most comfortless beds and indifferent food,
                    My tastes misunderstood.
                    I set my heart upon sounding fame;
                    Hurrah!
                        And, lo! I'm eclipsed by some upstart's
                            And, ah! [name;
                    When in public life I loomed quite high,
                        The folks that passed me would look awry;
                        Their very worst friend was I.
                    And then I set my heart upon war.
                    Hurrah! 
                    We gained some battles with eclat.
                        Hurrah! 
                    We troubled the foe with sword and
                        flame,—
                    And some of our friends fared quite the

                    Now I've set my heart upon nothing, you
                        Hurrah![see;
                    And the whole wide world belongs to me.
                    Hurrah!
                    The feast begins to run low, no doubt;
                    But at the old cask we'll have one good
                        bout:
                    Come, drink the lees all out!
                    But if there are many who censure
                        Goethe, there are more who defend him.
                        Among these we find Heinrich Heine, lively
                    and sarcastic, but most ingenious and
                        able, comparing the great poet to "the
                        oak of a hundred years, which the orthodox
                        hated, because it had no niche with
                        its holy image; and because the naked
                        Dryads of Paganism were permitted there
                        to play their witchery: which the liberals
                        hated, because it could not serve as
                        the tree of liberty, or at any rate as a
                        barricade; but which the many venerated,
                            for the very reason that it reared itself
                            with such independent grandeur, and
                            so graciously filled the world with its
                            odor, while its branches, streaming magnificently
                            toward heaven, made it appear
                            as if stars were only the fruit of its wondrous
                            limbs."
                        This criticism of Heine is followed by
                            the short and simple, but decided testimony
                            of Niebuhr to Goethe's indisputable
                            superiority as a poet. Last of all
                            comes the enthusiastic panegyric of Carlyle,
                            whose admiration, or rather reverence
                            for a man so opposite to his worshiper,
                            in every leading quality in mind
                            and heart, has always seemed to us an
                            inexplicable phenomenon.
                        Equally ardent, but much more intelligible,
                            is the devotion exhibited in Menzel's
                            glowing eulogy of Schiller, which
                            ushers in the selections from that poet.
                            Perhaps no writer ever possessed in a
                            higher degree that high prerogative of
                            genius, the power of awakening for himself
                            in the breasts of men the warmest
                            feelings of love and veneration. No
                            man who knows him, be his habits,
                            tastes and prejudices what they may, can
                            help sympathizing with the good people
                            of Leipzig, as they shouted at the first
                            representation of his Maid of Orleans,
                            "Es lebe Friederick Schiller." Though
                            his intellectual powers command our admiration,Schiller

                            it is his moral qualities, his earnestness,
                            his purity, his elevation of character,
                            that give him undisputed mastery
                            over the heart. All that he has written
                            bespeak a nature simple and honest, uncalculating,
                            unselfish, animated by the
                            noblest impulses, and yielding freely to
                            their sway. His life too is in perfect
                            harmony with his writings. It deserves
                            to be studied, both as illustrating much
                            in his works, that would otherwise be
                            obscure, and also because it possesses
                            in itself something of a tragic interest.
                            Its opening is marked by uncommon difficulties
                            and embarrassments: its progress
                            exhibits in the most vivid manner
                            the struggles of a great and earnest spirit
                            after light and truth: and as we approach

                        Schiller
                            ☞the close, his resolute endurance
                            under severe physical suffering, his conscientious
                            determination to spend every
                            energy in the service of mankind, his patient
                            and heroic death, invest him with
                            the dignity of a martyr.
                        The style of Schiller is like himself,
                            direct, earnest and impassioned. It is
                            the style of one, who feels that he has
                            within him great thoughts, of vital importance
                            sStyle;

                            thoughts, which must not be trusted to a
                            loose and careless statement, but worked
                            out in their development with the most
                            anxious and vigilant fidelity. His composition
                            presents everywhere an appearance
                            of effort, which at times renders it
                            even heavy. Yet its movement, if somewhat
                            tardy, is stately and majestic.
                            Richter has described it very happily.
                            "The perfection of pomp-prose we find
                            in Schiller: what the utmost splendor of
                            reflection in images, in fullness and antithesis
                            can give, he gives. Nay, often he
                            plays on the poetic strings with so rich
                            and jewel-loaded a hand, that the sparkling
                            mass disturbs, if not the playing,
                            yet our hearing of it."
                            Whatever may be said (and we are far
                                from denying that much may be said with
                                truth) of Goethe's great breadth and variety,
                                there can be little doubt, that, least
                                among American readers, Schiller is now,
                                and will long continue to be, the favorite
                                German poet. It is, perhaps, for this
                                very reason, that Mr. Longfellow has
                                given us so few specimens of his works:
                                and those even not in most instances his
                                best productions. We have indeed the
                                "Song of the Bell," and the "Knight
                                Toggenburg," but we miss the "Hymn
                                to Joy," the "Gods of Greece," the "Diver,"
                                "Thekla," and other poems which
                                the admirers of Schiller are accustomed
                                to regard as his masterpieces.
                            Goethe and Schiller have departed, and
                                left behind them no equal. Among the
                                most distinguished of their successors
                                may be reckoned Tieck, Chamisso, Uhland,
                                Schulze, Rückert, Heine, Hoffman,
                                and Frieligrath. Of these, no one, probably,
                                stands higher in the estimation of
                                his countrymen, than the Swabian poet,
                                Ludwig Uhland. His reputation rests
                                chiefly on his lyrical writings, which are
                                remarkable for depth of feeling and beauty
                                of poetical expression. He has little
                                humor. The perplexities and contrarieties
                                of life present themselves to him, not
                                under a ludicrous, but under a melancholy
                                aspect. Most of his pieces breathe a
                                spirit of serious and tender sadness: not
                                unfrequently he rises to cheerfulness, the
                                chastened joy of a mind accustomed to
                                sorrow; seldom, if ever, does he give
                                himself up to mirth and jollity. Yet in
                                his very sadness there is something
                                which elevates rather than depresses: it
                                is not weak or querulous, neither has it
                                a shade of misanthropy: it is rich in noble
                                thoughts, and full of faith and hope
                                and consolation. His soul is open to
                                every impression of nature: he discerns
                                the poetical elements which belong to
                                the commonest situations and incidents of
                                life. Everything which he contemplates,
                                becomes invested in his mind with a
                                beautiful halo of feeling and reflection.
                                The following piece, selected almost at
                                random, will perhaps give a better idea
                                of its author, than could be conveyed by
                                the most elaborate description.
                            THE PASSAGE.
                            Many a year is in its grave,
                            Since I crossed this restless wave;
                                And the evening, fair as ever,
                            Shines on ruin, rock and river.
                            
                            Then in this same boat beside
                            Sat two comrades old and tried—
                            One with all a father's truth,
                            One with all the fire of youth.
                                
                                One on earth in silence wrought,
                            And his grave in silence sought;
                            But the younger, brighter form
                            Passed in battle and in storm.
                                
                                So, whene'erwhenever I turn my eye
                            Back upon the days gone by,
                                    Saddening thoughts of friends come o'erover me,
                            Friends that closed their course before me.
                                    
                                    But what binds us, friend to friend,
                            But that soul with soul can blend?
                            Soul-like were those hours of yore;
                            Let us walk in soul once more.
                                    
                                    Take, O boatman, thrice thy fee—
                            Take, I give it willingly;
                            For, invisible to thee,
                            Spirits twain have crossed with me.
                            
                            Uhland's ballads are among the finest
                                of his works. Two of these, "The Luck
                                of Edenhall," and the "Black Knight,"
                                are set before us by the editor in his own
                                very skillful and perfect versions. We
                                cannot but hope that he will translate yet
                                more from a poet with whose genius he
                                has much in common, and whom he has
                                shown himself admirably qualified to represent
                                in our language. We extract

                            Bids sound the festal trumpet's call;
                            He rises at the banquet board,
                            And cries, 'mid the drunken revelers
                            all,
                            'Now bring me the Luck of Edenhall!'
                                
                                The butler hears the words with pain—
                                The house's oldest seneschal—
                                Takes slow from its silken cloth again
                                The drinking-glass of crystal tall;
                                They call it The Luck of Edenhall!
                                
                                Then said the lord, 'This glass to praise,
                                Fill with red wine from Portugal!'
                                The graybeard with trembling hand
                                obeys;
                                A purple light shines over all;
                                It beams from the Luck of Edenhall.
                                
                                Then speaks the lord, and waves it light:
                                'This glass of flashing crystal tall
                                Gave to my sires the Fountain-Sprite;
                                She wrote in it, If this glass doth fall,
                                Farewell then, O Luck of Edenhall!
                                
                                ''T was right a goblet the fate should be
                                Of the joyous race of Edenhall!
                                We drink deep draughts right willingly;
                                And willingly ring, with merry call,
                                Kling! klang! to the Luck of Edenhall!'
                                
                                
                                First rings it deep, and full, and mild,
                                Like to the song of a nightingale;
                                Then like the roar of a torrent wild;
                                Then mutters, at last, like the thunder's
                                fall,
                                The glorious Luck of Edenhall.
                                
                                'For its keeper, takes a race of might
                                The fragile goblet of crystal tall;
                                It has lasted longer than is right;
                                Kling! klang!—with a harder blow
                                than all
                                Will I try the Luck of Edenhall!'
                                
                                As the goblet, ringing, flies apart,
                                Suddenly cracks the vaulted hall;
                                And through the rift the flames upstart;
                                The guests in dust are scattered all
                                With the breaking Luck of Edenhall!
                                
                                In storms the foe, with fire and sword!
                                He in the night had scaled the wall;
                                Slain by the sword lies the youthful lord,
                                But holds in his hand the crystal tall,
                                The shattered Luck of Edenhall.
                                
                                On the morrow the butler gropes alone,
                                The graybeard, in the desert hall;
                                He seeks his lord's burnt skeleton;
                                He seeks in the dismal ruin's fall
                                The shards of the Luck of Edenhall.
                                
                                'The stone wall,' saith he, 'doth fall
                                aside;
                                Down must the stately columns fall;
                                Glass is this earth's Luck and Pride;
                                In atoms shall fall this earthly ball,
                                One day, like the Luck of Edenhall!'"

                        Not a few readers, it is to be feared, as
                            they turn the leaves of this work, will

                            lights upon the heading, "Dutch Poetry."
                            The literature of Holland, neglected in
                            Europe, is wholly undreamed of in America.
                            Not only do we know nothing of
                            the poetry which the Dutch have written,
                            but we very generally imagine them to be
                            quite incapable of writing poetry. A busy,
                            ☞bustling, thriving people, engaged from
                            time immemorial in commerce and the
                            arts, devoted to the pursuits of peace, and
                            on this account indisposed to war, we
                            have been accustomed to look upon them
                            as eminently a prosaic people. It has
                            seemed to us impossible that the Muses
                            should abide on their flat and monotonous
                            soil, where the treckschuyts move
                            lazily along through the muddy waters
                            of numberless canals. The unpicturesque
                            landscape, the dense fog, the mingled din
                            of trade and manufactures, have appeared
                            to us inevitably fatal to the cultivation of
                            taste and sentiment. To these prejudices,
                            which we share with the nations of Europe,
                            we have added others peculiar to
                            ourselves, founded partly on the character
                            of the Dutch population in some districts
                            of our own country, and partly, we
                            fear it must be admitted, on the comicohistorical
                            romance of our illustrious Irving.
                            The humorous exaggeration of
                            his Diedrich Knickerbocker is, indeed,
                            obvious enough to the dullest comprehension.
                            Yet so vivid are his representations,
                            such an air of reality belongs to
                            his most whimsical absurdities, that they
                            take fast hold on the imagination and the
                            memory; and while we fully recognize
                            their imaginary nature, produce upon our
                            minds a stronger impression than the
                            True
                            words
                            about
                            the
                            Dutchtruth. Without intending it, nay almost
                            in spite of ourselves, we form our ideas
                            of Dutch habits and Dutch character from
                            his fanciful descriptions. We can hardly
                            hear or speak or think of a Dutchman
                            without calling up to mental vision a
                            short, stumpy, obese personage, with
                            heavy face, bullet head, rolling gait, arrayed
                            in vestments ample alike in number
                            and dimensions, marvelously sparing
                            of words, but prodigal of tobacco-smoke.
                            Our minds, once preoccupied with this
                            ludicrous image, become incapable of doing
                            justice to the countrymen of Erasmus
                            and Hemsterhuys, of Rubens and
                            Van Dyk, of De Ruyter and Van Tromp,
                            of De Witt and Barneveldt and Grotius.
                            We forget the advanced civilization of
                            Holland, her education and intelligence,
                            her progress in the arts useful and ornamental,
                            her spirit of industry and enterprise,
                            her unconquerable love of freedom.
                            We forget that her people, few in numbers,
                            unused to war, unsupported by
                            foreign aid, maintained a seventy years'
                            struggle for their liberties against the
                            mightiest empire of the time; that they
                            afterwards contested with England long
                            and gloriously the supremacy of the
                            ocean; that their artists are inferior only
                            to the great masters of Italy; that their
                            scholars have been unsurpassed for genius
                            and erudition; that their writers on international
                            law are the acknowledged arbiters
                            of Europe. Why should we doubt
                            that a people who, against all disadvantages
                            of nature and of fortune, have been
                            able to achieve so much for themselves
                            and for the world, may possess all the
                            elements of poetry? Do we not find
                            among them, in their past and their present,
                            ardor of emotion, energy of will,
                            loftiness of purpose, an eye to discern
                            the beautiful, a head to understand the
                            true, and a heart to love the good? Nor
                            do they lack the necessary means of expression.
                            Their language, however rude
                            and vulgar it may sound, when spoken
                            by rude and vulgar men, (for such must
                            always be the speech of such men, whatever
                            the syllables they use,) is a highly
                            cultivated idiom, copious and flexible, the
                            appropriate and serviceable instrument of
                            the educated mind. A branch ot the great
                            Teutonic stock, it stands midway between
                            the German and the English, and may
                            safely be pronounced inferior to neither
                            in the most valuable qualities of a language.
                            Its excellences have been fully
                            proved by the numerous and able writers
                            who have used it. Certainly, if we may
                            judge of an author's merits by the affection
                            and enthusiasm which he awakens, we
                            must assign a very high rank to the poets
                            of the Netherlands. The Dutch, far from
                                undervaluing their poets, because they are
                                neglected by foreigners, only cling to them
                                with the greater attachment, as if they
                            wished that the writer who, by using
                            their language, has cut himself off from
                            general and wide-spread fame, should be
                            compensated for the sacrifice he has made
                            by the admiration and the love of those
                            for whose benefit he has made it.
                        Among the older poets of Holland the
                            most eminent are: Cats, Hooft, Van Der
                            Goes, and, above all, Vondel, the Coryphæus
                            of his country's literature, celebrated
                            as a universal genius, who tried
                            every species of poetry, and excelled in

                        The Poets and Poetry of Europe.
                        587
                        all. It must be confessed that the fragments
                            which we have here by no means
                            justify the reputation of their author.
                            They might even lead us, did we not
                            know the injustice of judging a great poet
                            from a few translated specimens, to fall
                            in with those who, in more recent times,
                            have ventured to criticisecriticize Vondel with
                            severity, and doubt or deny his preëminence.
                        
                        In Holland, as in every other country
                            of Europe, the eighteenth century was a
                            barren age for poetry. Its close, however,
                            was marked here, as everywhere
                            else, by the introduction of a new order
                            of things. Among those who took an
                            active part in the revival of Dutch literature,
                            the most conspicuous undoubtedly
                            was Bilderdijk. Through a long career
                            of authorship he was distinguished for
                            his profound and various learning, for the
                            voluminous extent of his productions, for
                            his energetic independence, and for the
                            number and the bitterness of his literary
                            quarrels. The warmth of his feelings,
                            and the asperity of his satire, may be
                            well enough illustrated by these few
                            lines, in which, speaking of the French
                            language, he says:—
                        "Begone! thou bastard tongue, so base, so
                            broken,
                            By human jackals and hyenas spoken; 
                            Formed for a race of infidels, and fit
                            To laugh at truth and scepticize in wit!
                            What stammering, snivelling sounds,
                            which scarcely dare
                            Through nasal channels to salute the ear,
                            Yet, helped by apes' grimaces and the
                            devil,
                            Have ruled the world, and ruled the
                            world for evil!"
                            Very different from Bilderdijk is the
                                amiable Tollens, who still lives, at an
                                advanced age, enjoying the honors
                                awarded him by his admiring countrymen.
                                As a specimen of his style, we
                                quote the following spirited verses:—
                        SUMMER MORNING'S SONG.
                            Up, sleeper! dreamer! up! for now
                                There's gold upon the mountain's brow—
                                There's light on forests, lakes and meadows—
                                The dew-drops shine on floweret-bells—
                                The village clock of morning tells.
                                Up, men! out, cattle! for the dells
                                And dingles teem with shadow.
                            Up! out! o'erover furrow and o'erover field!
                                The claims of toil some moments yield
                                For morning's bliss, and time is fleeter
                                Than thought;—so out! 'tis dawning
                                yet;
                                Why twilight's lovely hour forget?
                                For sweet though be the workman's
                                sweat,
                                The wanderer's sweat is sweeter.
                            
                            Up! to the fields! through shine and
                                stour!
                            What hath the dull and drowsy hour
                            So blest as this—the glad heart leaping
                            To hear morn's early songs sublime?
                            See earth rejoicing in its prime!
                            The summer is the waking time,
                            The winter time for sleeping.

                            O, happy, who the city's noise
                            Can quit for nature's quiet joys,
                            Quit worldly sin and worldly sorrow;
                            No more 'midst prison-walls abide,
                            But in God's temple vast and wide

                            features;

                            By wealth and wearying cares engrossed
                                —
                                For him a paradise is lost,
                            But not for happy creatures.
                            
                            Come—though a glance it may be—come,
                            Enjoy, improve; then hurry home,
                            For life's strong urgencies must bind us.
                            Yet mourn not; morn shall wake anew,
                            And we shall wake to bless it too.
                            Homewards!—the herds that shake the
                                dew
                            We'll leave in peace behind us.
                            
                        With Dutch poetry closes the first of
                            the two great parts into which this work
                            may be divided—the one, which embraces
                            the poetry of the Teutonic languages; the
                            second part is occupied with the literature
                            of Southern Europe—of France, Italy,
                            Spain and Portugal, countries in which
                            are spoken languages derived from the
                            Latin. There are many things in this
                            part of the book, especially under Italian
                            poetry, which we should be glad to notice;
                            but we have already exceeded our
                            allotted limits, and forbear to trespass
                            farther at present on the patience of the
                            reader.

                            [We give, in this number, the last chapter which we shall probably be able to present to
                                our readers, of the "Notes by the Road." We cannot but feel that they have gratified
                                many, where our Magazine is read; and we believe that they will learn with pleasure that
                                a portion of his sketches, including one or two of the chapters published in the Review, but
                                mainly on entirely fresh ground, may soon be given to the public. For a narrative of pleasant,
                                minute observations, written in a graceful, subdued style, slightly quaint, making the
                                reader an easy-minded companion of the rambling traveler—a style quite new under the
                                prevailing taste for rapid and vigorous writing—we venture to bespeak, we might say, predict,
                                beforehand, a most favorable reception. The writer's quick-eyed observations have
                                covered many parts of Europe; the green lanes, and by-ways, and busy thoroughfares of
                                England—the solitary heaths and hills of Scotland—the life led in London and Paris—the
                                quaint and simple forms of things in France and Dutch-land—the ever-great scenery of the
                                Alps—the scenes and associations, never yet exhausted, of "remembered Italy." With
                                such things to talk about, and a certain way of telling his story, we do not see why his should
                                not be a "proper book."—ED. AM REV.]
                            CAMERON would not go with me to Bremen:
                                so I left him at Hamburg—at dinner
                                —at the table of the Kronprinzen
                                Charles, on the sunny side of the Jungfernstieg.
                                There was, it is true, a great
                                deal to detain him in the old free city:—
                                there was the Alster, stretching out under
                                our chamber windows in a broad sheet,
                                with elegant new houses flanking it,
                                with little skiffs paddling over it, from
                                which the music floated up to our ears at
                                eventide; and beyond it was the belt of
                                road, along which dashing equipages ran
                                all day, and from which rose up out of the
                                very edge of the water, the great wind-mill
                                that flung the black shadows of its
                                slouching arms, half way to the 'maiden's
                                walk,' when the sun was riding over the
                                tops of the gardens of Vierland. Jenny
                                Lind was coming to sing to the Hamburgers,
                                and Cameron had secured a
                                seat: beside, there were two beautiful
                                Russian girls sitting vis à vis at the table
                                where I left him, and a Swedish bride as
                                pretty as the picture of Poliphar's wife in
                                the palace of Barberini at Rome. And
                                there was a gay little Prussian girl, who
                                could speak just enough English to enlist
                                the sympathies of my Scotch friend, and
                                to puzzle prodigiously her staid German
                                Papa. I know very well, by the mischief
                                that was in her eye, that she did not
                                translate truly to her Papa, all the little
                                gossip that passed between her and fun-
                                loving Cameron, or my friend would
                                have had, as sure as the world, a snatch
                                of the old man's cane. Whether it was
                                such company, or the "hung beef" that
                                held him, Cameron would not go with
                                me to Bremen.
                            I could have staidstayed at Hamburg myself.
                                It is a queer old city, lying just where the
                                Elbe, coming down from the mountains
                                of Bohemia through the wild gaps of
                                Saxony and everlasting plains of Prussia,
                                pours its muddy waters into a long
                                arm of the Mer du Nord. The new city,
                                built over the ruins of the fire is elegant,
                                and almost Paris-like; and out of it, one
                                wanders, before he is aware, into the
                                narrow alleys of the old Dutch gables.
                                And blackened cross beams, and overlapping
                                roofs, and diamond panes, and
                                scores of smart Dutch caps, are looking
                                down on him as he wanders entranced.
                                It is the strangest contrast of cities that
                                can be seen in Europe. One hour, you
                                are in a world that has an old age of
                                centuries:—pavement, sideways, houses,
                                everything old, and the smoke curling in
                                an old-fashioned way out of monstrous
                                chimney-stacks, into the murky sky:
                                five minutes' walk will bring one from
                                the midst of this into a region where all
                                is shockingly new;—Parisian shops, with
                                Parisian plate glass in the windows; Parisian
                                shopkeepers, with Parisian gold
                                in the till. The contrast was tormenting.
                                Before the smooth cut shops that are
                                ranged around the basin of the Alster,
                                one could not persuade himself that he
                                was in the quaint old Hanse town of
                                Jew brokers, and storks' nests, that he
                                had come to see; or when he wandered
                                upon the quays that are lined up and
                                down with such true Dutch-looking
                                houses, it would seem that he was out of
                                all reach of the splendid hotel of the
                                Crown Prince, and the prim porter who
                                sports his livery at the door. The
