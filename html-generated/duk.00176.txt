                Clipping is from Charles Knight's editorial introduction to Buffon's "The First Man," in Half-Hours with the Best Authors (New York: Wiley, 1853), 1:155. There is writing on the verso that does not appear to be in Whitman's hand.

            LafontaineLaFontaine, born about 1621
            lived 73 years —(1694)
            was of good family, inherited some
            property,—wrote fables in verse—
            somewhat like Æsop's—also
            wrote poems &amp; plays—lived
            20 years supported by a noble
            lady in her house—was
            intimate with (?Racine, Boileau,
            Bossuet, Moliere).—
            
                
                    
                        
                            
                            BUFFON.
                            [THE Comte de Buffon, the most eloquent if not the most accurate of naturalists,
                            was born in 1707, and died in 1788. More than two-thirds of his fourscore
                            years were passed in unremitting literary labor. He was rich, luxurious,
                            fond of display,—yet he went to bed every night at nine o'clock, and began
                            his appointed task every morning at six. In his latter years, when asked how
                            he could have done so much, he replied, "Have I not spent fifty years at my
                            desk?" The passage which we translate from his chapter on "Man," will
                            give a notion of the fertility of his imagination, under the guidance of science.]
