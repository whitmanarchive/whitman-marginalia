                Grier estimates that this was written in the late 1850s (Walt Whitman: Notebooks and Unpublished Manuscripts, ed. Edward F. Grier [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 6:2034). "The New Jerusalem" was first published in Volume 13.6 of Household Words (1856): 136-141, edited by Charles Dickens; the excerpt here is an unidentified reprinting. George Hogarth was the father of Dickens’ wife, Catherine Thomson Dickens (née Hogarth); see Kathryn Brigger Kruger, “Walt Whitman’s ‘Who Was Swedenborg?’” Walt Whitman Quarterly Review 31 (Fall 2013/Winter 2014), 55-68.

                The New Jerusalem.
                EmanualEmanuel Swedenborg was no vulgar fanatic.—
                He was distinguished by his social position, his
                eminence in science and literature, his active pursuits
                as a man of the world, and his high personal
                character during his whole life. He was the
                son of a Lutheran bishop, and was born at Stockholm
                in sixteen hundred and eighty-eight. He
                distinguished himself in the physical sciences
                and the practical arts connected with them; and
                his various works in mathematics, chemistry,
                and physiology, hold a high place in the literature
                of the day. He received honors from the
                principal scientific bodies of Europe, and was
                appointed by Charles XII. Inspector General of
                the Mines, as a reward for important services
                rendered by him to the king. The royal favor
                was continued to him by Charles's successor,
                Queen Ulrica, by whom he was ennobled, with
                the title of baron. Such was his life till (three
                    score and ten,)  when he suddenly renounced the
                    world, resigned his public offices, and began to
                    proclaim his celestial mission, which, according
                    to his own account, he had received some years
                    before. In the preface to one of his mystical
                    treatises (De Cœlo et Inferno) he says:—
                    "I was dining very late one day at my lodgings
                    in London (this was in seventeen hundred
                    and forty-three)—and was eating heartily.—
                    When I was finishing my meal I saw a sort of
                    mist around me, and the floor covered with hideous
                    reptiles. They disappeared: the mist cleared
                    up; and I saw plainly, in the midst of a vivid
                    light, a man sitting in the corner of the room,
                    who said with a terrible voice, Don't eat so
                    much. Darkness again gathered around me—it
                    was dissipated by degrees, and I found myself
                    alone. The following night the same man, radiant
                    with light, appeared to me and said: I
                    the Lord, the Creator and the Redeemer, have
                    chosen thee to explain to mankind the inward
                    and spiritual sense of the Holy Scriptures, and I
                    shall dictate what thou art to write. That night
                    the eyes of my inner man were opened, and enabled
                    to look into heaven, the world of spirits,
                    and hell; and there I saw many persons of my
                    acquaintance, some dead long before, and others
                    recently. He spent the latter years of his life in
                    publishing, in quick succession, a multitude of
                    works, reporting his conversations with God, angels,
                    and spirits of the dead, and describing visits,
                    not only to the planets of our solar system,
                    but to the fixed stars in the remotest regions of
                    the universe. He always speaks as an eye or an
                    ear witness: Such is what the Lord hath revealed
                    to me: Such is what the angels hath told me.
                    He relates with minuteness his dialogues and disputations
                    with the beings of other worlds; describes
                    their appearance, habits and manners in a
                    familiar and matter-of-fact way, which reminds
                    us of the writings of Defoe; and uses the same style
                    in describing the things he saw and heard among
                    angels and spirits, and even in the presence of
                    God himself. All these revelations are given as
                    the proofs and illustrations of the mystical doctrines
                    which he is commissioned to teach, and
                    he claims for them all the authority due to immediate
                    communications from heaven. His visions,
                    and the mystical system founded upon
                    them, excited curiosity, heightened by the eminence
                    of his name. They began to act upon the
                    imagination and command the belief of many
                    educated people—for his books were written in
                    Latin; till the Swedish clergy took the alarm
                    and obtained from the government a commission
                    to inquire into his heresies. Nothing, however,
                    came of the inquiry, and Swedenborg was
                    allowed to go on in his own way without molestation.
                    He lived very quietly in a small house
                    in Stockholm, where he had many visitors drawn
                    by his writings from other countries as well as
                    his own. In his reception of them he exhibited
                        
                    
                
            
                
            2
                
                
                    
                        
                            
                a good deal of the charlatan. His chamber was
                hung with mystical pictures; and, when a
                stranger, after waiting a due time, was admitted,
                the sage was discovered in profound meditation,
                or, unconscious of mortal presence, engaged in
                colloquy sublime with some invisible visitant
                from the world of spirits. His life, however,
                is admitted on all hands, to have been irreproachable;
                his habits were simple; and being in easy
                circumstances, he does not seem ever to have
                turned his divine mission to any wordlyworldly account.
                He died in England of apoplexy in seventeen
                hundred and seventy-two, at the age of eighty-
                five, and his remains rest in the Swedish church
                in Ratcliffe Highway.
                The Swedenborgian revelations, and the
                    strange creed founded upon them, have by no
                    means been a passing delusion. Though Swedenborg's
                    followers have not made a great noise in
                    the world, yet, they appear to have been gradually
                    increasing in numbers from the time of his
                    death down to our day. His theological tenets,
                    though at variance with the fundamental principles
                    of Christianity, were adopted in this country
                    by professed Christians and even by clergymen
                    of the Church of England. In the year 1770,
                    the Reverend T. Hartley, rector of Winwick,
                    translated several of his works, particularly one
                    of the wildest of them all, the treatise on Heaven
                    anhand Hell, from which we have already quoted
                    his account of the way in which he received his
                    divine mission from the lips of God himself. It
                    is said that above fifty English clergymen became
                    early converts to his faith. Among its
                    most zealous votaries was the Rev. Mr. Clowes,
                    rector of St. John's, Manchester, who, nevertheless,
                    remained in communion with the church
                    and held his benefice till his death in 1831. This
                    anomaly seems to have arisen from the circumstance,
                    that Swedenborg did not reject the authority
                    of the scriptures.
                On the contrary, he made them the foundation
                    of his doctrines, expounded them in the spiritual
                    sense revealed to him, for the first time, by
                    direct communication with the world of spirits.
                    The Swedenborgians still call themselves Christians,
                    though none of them, we believe, now
                    hold communion with any Christian sect. They
                    are united under the denomination of the New
                    Jerusalem Church—a body, which, in Great
                    Britain alone has several thousand members.—
                    They have places of worship in London and
                    most of the principal towns. Their church has
                    a regular constitution, holds annual conferences
                    in the metropolis, and has its own liturgy and
                    ritual modelled on the forms of the Church of
                    England.
                The Swedenborgian books form a library by no
                    means inconsiderable. More than forty years
                    ago a society was formed in London for the purpose
                    of publishing and circulating the writings
                    of Swedenborg. This society, which still exists,
                    has been active in its vocation; and the translations
                    of these works, with the dissertations and
                    commentaries of the English editors, evince
                    learinglearning and literary ability.
                It is observable that wherever he wanders,
                    though it be into the remotest regions of the
                    universe—with whomsoever he holds converse,
                    though it be with the Supreme Being himself,
                    with his angels, or with the illustrious dead 
                    every age and every nation—all is very commonplace,
                    and nothing is removed an iota above the
                    level of our ordinary earthly existence.
                One of his books—a goodly volume published
                    by the society aforesaid—is entitled. "On the
                    Earths in our Solar System which are called
                    Planets, and on the Earths in the Starry HeavnsHeavens;

                ShakspeareShakespeare versus Sand.
                481
                All this feeling, which we have here
                    perhaps exaggerated, makes us distrustful
                    when we hear French novels cried up
                    as great, pure, deep, and the like. Yet
                    we fancy it does not operate so strongly
                    as to blind us to real merit; it only
                    throws the burden of proof on the
                    novels. Good has come out of Nazareth,
                    notwithstanding the proverb, and
                    France may yet give the world a ShakspeareShakespeare.
                
                But that a female ShakspeareShakespeare has
                now arisen in the person of Madame
                Sand, we do not believe. We have read,
                we are happy to say, only one of her
                    novels, and are therefore better qualified to
                    speak of them than if we had read more,
                    as hands that are but a little soiled are
                    fitter to lay on white paper than those
                    that have been washed in mire. Perhaps
                    if we had read more we should
                    condescend to argue against them, which
                    now appears absurd; our common sense
                    might have become obscured. We read
                    only the one where a woman of the
                    most exalted virtue aggravates a green
                    young man through a reasonably sized
                    volume, and never gives him any satisfaction;
                    but when she has fooled him to
                    the top of his bent, turns him off forever.
                    Consuelo we are yet innocent of, and
                    from the work we read, and all that
                    we have heard of this, we feel almost so
                    strong in resolution as not to need to
                    pray to be preserved from it. When an
                    inexperienced youth first comes to the
                    city, he takes every man he meets who
                    goes unshorn and wears frogs on his
                    coat, for a foreign marquis, but by and
                    by, he learns that one whom he thought
                    most high in rank, is nothing but a poor
                    barber, and his illusion vanishes forever.
                    Whiskers and frogs have, with him, lost
                    their charm. So it is with these high
                    transcendental novels, that are so crammed
                    with poetry, philosophy, and chastity.
                    A man of sense, accustomed to our
                    grand old poets, and our better novels,
                    needs to read but one of them—cannot
                    read more. For with his mind stored
                    with images of real natural beauty, how
                    shall he find room for the false and half-
                    made creations of Parisian debauchees
                    and harlots, that write they care not
                    what, so it gives them the means to support
                    their luxury or pamper their vanity?
                    How can he please himself with glitter
                    of words, and tedious questionings of
                    great truths that it goes against the
                    stomach of his sense to doubt? If these
                    writers would only leave us alone in our
                    simple religious faith, in our common
                    views of God, ourselves, and the world,
                    their mere horrors and licentiousness
                    would not be so bad, though still bad
                    enough. But they muddle the mind, and
                    make the voice of reason and conscience
                    "an uncertain sound." Observe the admirers
                    of Sand. Are they not Sand-blind?
                    yea, "high gravel blind," most of them?
                    Can they understand ShakspeareShakespeare? Do
                    they relish anything in him after the manner
                    of those that can see? No! they
                    are all wildered; nothing is too daring
                    for them in speculation; little common
                    thoughts that have been thought over
                    and over by every soul that lives, they
                    seize upon as discoveries; whatever subject
                    they take up, they discuss with
                    equal irreverence and defiance of sense;
                    there is no teaching them, and the more
                    you argue with them the plainer it appears
                    that they are incapable of being
                    convinced by reasons; and you are forced
                    to the conclusion that either there is,
                    and ever has been, nothing settled in the
                    world or that they are crazy.
                The number of poor young gentlemen
                and ladies all over the country that
                are already in this deplorable condition,
                it is frightful to contemplate. They tell
                us "there is a good time coming!" But
                we don't believe it. We have yet hope
                that what they understand by the "good
                time," will never come. We believe that
                virtue will be virtue, and vice, vice, in
                the next generation as now. We trust
                too that the Bible, and the Christian religion,
                will be left so that simple-minded
                people may still rest secure in faith and
                hope, however much they that are compelled
                to choose a belief, may be at the
                mercy of indifference. We have yet
                confidence in the Saxon blood, in the reality
                of knowledge, and in the mercy of
                Heaven. In a word, we have firm faith,
                that however these vagaries, and fevers,
                and fashions, may hinder growth and interrupt
                true progress, they will all yield
                in time to the silent influence of Truth
                and the invincible power of COMMON
                    SENSE.
            
                
                
                    
                        
                            
                also of the Spirits and Angels there; from what
                has been heard and seen." This will afford several
                extracts.
                Swedenborg visits the planet Mercury. "I
                    was desirous to know what kind of face and
                    body the men in the earth Mercury had, whether
                    they were like the men on our earth. Instantly
                    there was presented before my eyes a woman
                    exactly resembling the women in that earth.—
                    She had a beautiful face but it was smaller than
                    that of a woman of our earth; her body was
                    more slender, but her height was equal. She
                    wore on her head a linen cap, which was put on
                    without art, but yet in a becoming manner. A
                    man also was presented to view, who was more
                    slender in body than the men of our earth are.
                    He was clad in a garment of a dark blue color,
                    closely fitted to his body," and so forth. He also
                    saw oxen, horses, sheep, &amp;c. Notwithstanding
                    the nearness to the sun the temperature was
                    moderate; a phenomenon for which supposable
                    scientific reasons are assigned.
                Then he went to Jupiter. But he did not (like
                    Voltaire in his Micromegas) finds that the inhabitants
                    of that immense planet were giants. He
                    tells us that the inhabitants of Jupiter "are distinguished
                    unto nations, families, and houses,
                    and that no one covets another's property.—
                    When I would have told them that on this earth
                    there are wars, depredations, and murders, they
                    instantly turned away from me and expressed
                    aversion.' Here we are reminded of Gulliver's
                    journey to Brobdingnag. When Gulliver has
                    given the king of that country his bitterly satirical
                    description of Europe, his majesty replies,
                    'Your natives must be the most pernacious race
                    of little odious vermin that nature ever suffered
                    to crawl upon the face of the earth.' The people
                     of Jupiter, we are further told, 'do not walk
                     erect, nor creep on all fours, but, as they go
                     along, they assist themselves with their hands,
                     and alternately half elevate themselves on their
                     feet, and also at every third step turn the face
                     sideways and behind them, and at the same time
                     bend the body a little, for it is thought indecent
                     to be seen in any other point of view than with
                     the face in front.' These good people, moreover,
                     sit cross-legged.
                They who live in warm climates go naked, but
                    all are perfectly chaste. When they lie in bed
                    they turn their faces forward, but not towards
                    the wall, 'because they believe that in turning
                    the face forward they turn it to the Lord. I
                    have sometimes (adds Swedenborg) when in bed
                    observed in myself such a direction of the face,
                    but I never knew whence it was.'
                Such are the manners and customs of the people
                    in the planet Jupiter. Similar descriptions
                    are given of the inhabitants of Venus, Mars, Saturn,
                    and several of the fixed stars. Of Saturn
                    Swedenborg borrows his ideas from known astronomical
                    facts. That planet, he avers, is illuminated
                    at night by light from its satellites and its
                    belt or ring; which last object appears to the inhabitants
                    as something whitish, like snow in the
                    heavens. As to the people, they are very like
                    ourselves, and are clothed with coarse skins or
                    coats, 'to' (oddly enough) 'keep out the cold.'—
                    In one of the stars, the wonderful Seer witnessed
                    a scene like the last judgment. 'There was seen
                    an obscure cloud towards the east descending
                    from on high, which, in its descent, appeared by
                    degrees bright and in a human form; and at
                    length this human form appeared in beams of
                    flaming lustre. Thus the Lord presented himself
                    before the spirits with whom I was discoursing.
                    At His presence all the spirits were gathered
                    together from all sides; and when they were
                    come they were separated, the good to the right,
                    the evil to the left, and this in an instant of
                    own accord; and the good were left to form a
                    celestial society, but the evil were cast into the
                    hells.'
                In another star, the people are clad after a
                    curious fashion. "There was a man with his
                    wife. The woman had before her bosom a cloak
                    or covering broad enough to conceal herself behind
                
                
                    
                        
                            
                it, which was so contrived that she could
                put her arms in it and use it as a garment, and so
                walk about her business; it might be tucked up
                as to the lower part, and then it appeared like a
                stomacher such as are worn by the women of our
                earth; but the same also served the man for a
                covering, and he was seen to take it from the
                woman and apply it to his back, and loosen the
                lower part which thus flowed down to his feet
                like a gown; and clothed in this manner, he
                walked off."
                There is another little star, one of the smallest
                    he says, in the starry heavens, being scarce five
                    hundred German miles in circumference. The
                    sun of that earth, to us, like a star, appears
                    there, flaming in size about the fourth part of
                    our sun. In that diminutive world the year is
                    about two hundred days, and the day fifteen
                    hours: yet there were men, women, and children,
                    animals, fields of corn, trees, fruits, flowers,
                    &amp;c., all exactly as we have them here at
                    home.
                In this way EmanualEmanuel Swedenborg settles conclusively,
                    from his own personal knowledge, the
                    sublime question of the plurality of worlds—a
                    question much mooted of late, and on which
                    some doubts have been raised by learned professors
                    and divines, as if it were heterodox
                    to believe that the boundless universe contains
                    any inhabited world save our own. How
                    such a doubt can dwell for a moment on the mind
                    of a human being who looks up to the starry
                    heavens—sees the myriads of shining orbs which
                    surround us—knows that there are myriads
                    and myriads more stretching into the regions of
                    space and growing in countless numbers as the
                    aids of science extend our powers of vision, and
                    considers that among them our little abode is as
                    a single grain among all the sands of the ocean;
                    how we say, such doubts can exist, is to us incomprehensible.
                    We believe, indeed only from
                    reason and anologyanalogy, and remain in the dark as
                    mysterious beings who people the regions of space
                    while the Swedenborgians, infinitely far happier
                    not only know their existence, but everything
                    about them more exactly and minutely than
                    about the inhabitants of the wilds of Africa
                    or Central America.
                We do not find it easy to explain Swedenborg's
                    views of "the spiritual world," as we often fail
                    to understand his meaning; but we will endeavor
                    to present a general idea of them. The
                    'spiritual world,' he holds, does not exist in space.
                    'Of this,' he says I was convinced, because I could
                    there see Africans and Indians very near me, tho'though
                    they are so many miles distant here on earth; nay,
                    that I could be made present with the inhabitants
                    of other planets in our system, and also
                    with the inhabitants of planets in other systems
                    revolving round other suns. By virtue of such
                    presence I have conversed with aspostlesapostles, departed
                    popes, emperors, and kings, with Luther,
                    Melancthon, and Calvin, and others from distant
                    countries." Notwithstanding however the non-
                    existence of space in the spiritual world, everything
                    retains its material aspect. 'After death
                    a man is so little changed that he does not know
                    but he is living in the present world; he eats
                    and drinks and enjoys conjugal delights. In the
                    spiritual world there are cities, palaces, houses,
                    books, and writings, trades and merchandizes,
                    gold, silver, and precious stones; everything as
                    in the natural world, but in an infinitely more
                    perfect state." In as far as we can make out the
                    meaning of this revelation Swedenborg holds each
                    material world has a distinct spiritual world connected
                    with it. The spirits belonging to this
                    earth and to each of the other earths, of which
                    the universe consists (for he brings them all under
                    the same general law) are located in some
                    incomprehensible manner (seeing that they do
                    not exist in space) near the earth which they inhabited
                    in the body. When men—that is, the
                    inhabitants of this and all other worlds—die,
                    they are clothed with a substantial body instead
                    of the material body they throw off. And in
                    these substantial bodies they continue to live in
                    a substantial though not a material world, in
                    the same manner (as we have seen) as they did
                    before.

                The distinction between two states of bodily
                existence, the material and the substantial, metaphysically
                subtle as it seems, is familiar to us
                all. It appears something natural and instinctive,
                and has been the foundation of all the beliefs
                and superstitions of the untutored mind,
                ever since the world began—the rude notions of
                the savage as well as the exquisite dream of the
                poet. It is the belief expressadexpressed by Banquo, when
                he gazes on the vanishing witches—
                The earth hath bubbles as the water has,
                And those are of them.
                And so beautifully illustrated by Addison in his
                tale of Marraton, the Indian chief who penetrates
                into the world of spirits. "This happy
                region was peopled with innumerable swarms of
                spirits, who applied themselves to exercises and
                diversions according as their fancies led them.—
                Some of them were tossing the figure of a quoit;
                others were pitching the shadow of a bar; others
                were breaking the apparition of a horse; and
                multitudes employing themselves upon ingenious
                handicrafts with the souls of departed utensils,
                for that is the name which in the Indian
                language they give their tools when they are
                burnt or broken." Marraton sees his wife,
                whose recent death he is lamenting, standing on
                the opposite bank of a river. "Her arms were
                stretched out towards him; floods of tears
                ran from her eyes; her looks, her hands, her
                voice, called him over to her, and at the same
                time seemed to tell him that the river was impassable."
                He plunges, nevertheless, into the
                stream, and finding it to be nothing but "the
                phantom of a river," crosses over, and the spirit
                of his Yaratilda clasps him in her arms. The
                spiritual world of the rude Indian is exactly the
                spiritual world of EmanualEmanuel Swedenborg.
                In the spiritual world of our earth, we are
                    told, the different nations form separate communities
                    as in the material world. The "noble
                    English nation," as Swedenborg pays us the compliment
                    to call us, have a great city, like London,
                    where the good reside; and another great
                    city, in the north, into which "those who are
                    inwardly wicked enter after death. In the middle
                    of it there is an open communication with
                    hell, by which the inhabitants are absorbed in
                    their turns.'
                He conversed with many remarkable men, of
                    whose condition in the world of spirits we have
                    some curious revelations. "I have conversed
                    with Melancthon, and questioned him concerning
                    his state; but he was not willing to make
                    any reply, wherefore I was informed of his lot by
                    others.
                "They told me that he is in a fretted stone
                    chamber, and in hell alternately; and that in
                    his chamber he appears clad in a bear's skin on
                    account of the cold, and that such is the filth
                    there that he does not admit those visitors from
                    the world whom the repute of his name inspires
                    with a desire of seeing him. He still speaks in
                    faith alone, which in the world he was foremost
                    in establishing.
                
                
                    
                        
                            
                He also spoke with Calvin and Luther. "Calvin
                was accepted in good society in heaven, because
                he was honest and made no disturbance.—
                Luther is still in the world of spirits, between
                heaven and hell, where he sometimes undergoes
                great sufferings." He conversed wtih Louis the
                Fourteenth, who "while he lived in the world,
                worshipped the Lord, read the Word, and acknowledacknowledged
                    the Pope only as the head of the Church;
                    in consequence of which he has great dignity in
                    the spiritual world, and governs the best society
                    of the French nation." This interview, Swedenborg
                    adds., with great exactness, "happened in
                    the year 1759, on the 13th day of December,
                    about eight o'clock in the evening." We cannot
                    doubt the accuracy of an incident the date of
                    which is given with such precision: and in considering
                    the earthly career of the Grand Monarch,
                    we are really glad to hear that he is so well
                    off.
                There is a Jew's quarter in the spiritual
                    world. "They live in two cities, to which they
                    are led after death. In these cities converted
                    Jews are appointed over them, who admonish
                    them not to speak disrespectfulldisrespectful of Christ, and
                    punish those who persist in doing so. The streets
                    of their cities are filled with mire up to the ankles,
                    and their honses are full of filth, and so offensive
                    to the smell that none can approach
                    them.
                In the spiritual world, as in the natural, they
                    traffic in various articles, especially precious
                    stones, which by unknown ways they procure for
                    themselves from heaven, where precious stones
                    exist in abundance. The reason of their trade in
                    precious stones is, that they read the word in its
                    original language, and hold the sense of its letter
                    sacred; and precious ttonesstones correspond to the
                    sense of the letter of the Word."
                Into the theological tenets of the New Jerusalem
                    Church we are not inclined to enter. They
                    are derived from the Swedenborgian interpretations
                    of the Holy Scriptures, founded on direct
                    revelation. "Once," says Swedenborg, "Mary,
                    the mother of God, passed by, and appeared
                    clothed in white raiment." She gave the author
                    some information which we shall not quote—
                    His ideas of a future state may be gathered from
                    the preceding extracts. All those passages of
                    scripture which are generally supposed to refer
                    to the destruction of the world and the final
                    judgment, must, according to him, be understood
                    to mean the consummation of the Christian
                    Church and the establishment of the New
                    Jerusalem Church, an event which he affirms
                    was accomplished in the spiritual world in the
                    year 1757.
                The extensive and long-continued belief commanded
                    by the revelations and doctrines of Swedenborg
                    is a fact so curious, that ttit has induced
                    us to present these specimens to the reader, unattended
                    by our comments or our opinions.
