                <p class="tei_p">W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HEN</span> any great work of art perishes from among us, we not only 
                grieve, but we rebel against the decree of fate. The wars, the traffic,
                the mechanical arts of old, nay even the men and women, wither 
                into an oblivion which is not painful but kindly. We sigh and smile 
                and acquiesce—better so, for here was nothing fitted to endure for 
                ever. They had their time, as we have ours, and who would wish 
                that the strife, the bustle, the men of to-day should last for ever? 
                But the destruction of any beautiful thing, whether it be the work of 
                art or nature, fills us, on the contrary, with sickening regret. The 
                temple, statue, picture gone imply a loss of joy to uncounted gene 
                rations. We suffer real pain when we think of lost tragedies by 
                Sophocles, and our whole classical system of education is a protest 
                that though kingdoms, peoples, tongues may die, their works of 
                beauty shall endure.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">If this be our feeling as to the more durable works of art, what 
                    shall we say of those triumphs which by their very nature last no 
                    longer than the action which creates them—the triumphs of the 
                    orator, the singer, or the actor? There is an anodyne in the 
                    words 'must be so,' 'inevitable,' and there is even some absurdity in 
                    longing for the impossible. This anodyne and our sense of humour 
                    temper the unhappiness we feel when, after hearing some great performance, 
                    we leave the theatre and think, 'Well, this great thing has been, 
                    and all that is now left of it is the feeble print upon my brain, the 
                    <span class="tei_supplied tei_supplied_reason_cut tei_supplied_reason_away tei_supplied_source_r1">little th</span>rill which memory will send along my nerves, mine and my 
                    neighbours'; as we live longer the print and thrill must grow feebler, 
                    and when we pass away the impress of the great artist will vanish 
                    from the world.' The regret that a great art should in its nature be 
                    transitory explains the lively interest which many feel in reading 
                    anecdotes or descriptions of a great actor, and it is this feeling which 
                    prompts the publication of the following notes on Mrs. Siddons' 
                    acting made by an eye-witness of ability and true artistic feeling.</p>

                        that of the writers, but that, even when representing Shakespeare, 
                        she supplied much which enriched the conceptions of the poet. 
                        To-day we often speak of an actor as the mere interpreter of Shakespeare. 
                        We are apt to imagine that there is some one Hamlet 
                        or Lady Macbeth, a creature of Shakespeare's brain, an <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">eidolon</span> which 
                        the actor must of necessity endeavour to represent, his success being 
                        measured by the approach which he makes to this unattainable ideal. 
                        Those, however, who have seen the acting of the last thirty years in 
                        Paris will know that this view of the actor's province is far from true 
                        when he interprets even the best modern authors. They know that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2">an 
                        actor, when he receives the manuscript, has to create his part</span> in the 
                        sense of conceiving a complete human being who, under the given 
                        circumstances, employs the words which the author has supplied. 
                        They know that no critic could, by reading a play, evolve a portrait 
                        of the man whom an original actor will represent as the embodiment 
                        of some new part. They know that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2">each new actor of real merit recreates 
                            the persons of the older drama, sending traditions to the 
                            winds and producing a new person on the stage</span> using the old words, 
                        but with marvellous differences of manner, voice, gesture and intention. 
                        They know that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2">there is not merely one good way of representing 
                        a great part, but as many ways as there are great actors.</span> 
                        <span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">Each actor is bound so to fashion his conception that his own physical 
                        attributes and mental powers will lend themselves to its execution, 
                        and thus the great parts on the French stage have bound up with 
                        them a long series of portraits each representing the creation of a 
                        separate actor—all the creations good and to be judged of on their 
                        own merits, not by reference simply to the mind of the author.</span></p>

                        Shakespeare meant his Hamlet to feel, and then try to express those 
                        emotions in tones which would indicate them to others. If honest

                    prove the great interest taken in Mrs. Siddons' acting. They contain 
                    acting editions of the plays in which she appeared, edited by Mrs. 
                    Inchbald. Professor Bell was himself in the habit of reading aloud, 
                    and, besides critical remarks, he has noted in many places the rise or 
                    fall of Mrs. Siddons' voice, putting a mark / for a rise, and \ for a 
                    fall. The words on which the emphasis fell are underlined. The 
                    following is an introductory note on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Macbeth:</span>—
                
                    <span class="inline_quote"><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">Of Lady Macbeth there is not a great deal in this play, but the wonderful 
                    genius of Mrs. Siddons makes it the whole. She makes it tell the whole story of 
                    the ambitious project, the disappointment, the remorse, the sickness and despair of 
                    guilty ambition, the attainment of whose object is no cure for the wounds of the 
                    spirit. Macbeth in Kemble's hand is only a cooperating part. I can conceive 
                    Garrick to have sunk Lady Macbeth as much as Mrs. Siddons does Macbeth, yet 
                    when you see Mrs. Siddons play this part you scarcely can believe that any acting 
                    could make her part subordinate. Her turbulent and inhuman strength of spirit 
                    does all. She turns Macbeth to her purpose, makes him her mere instrument, 
                    guides, directs, and inspires the whole plot. Like Macbeth's evil genius she hurries 
                    him on in the mad career of ambition and cruelty from which his nature would 
                    have shrunk. The flagging of her spirit, the melancholy and dismal blank beginning 
                    to steal upon her, is one of the finest lessons of the drama. The moral is 
                    complete in the despair of Macbeth, the fond regret of both for that state of innocence 
                    from which their wild ambition has hurried them to their undoing.</span></span>
                    
                    The writer of this note obviously, like Milton, considered a tragedy 
                    the moralest of poems, as indeed it is; but special attention may be 
                    paid to two points. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2">First, Mrs. Siddons did not herself conceive 
                    Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth as turbulent and with inhuman strength; 
                    she represented her as a woman of this type because this conception 
                    <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_note_place_left tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_note_resp_h2 note"><span>☞ </span></span>suited her physical powers and appearance.</span> But in her own memoranda, 
                    published in her life by Campbell, she speaks thus of Lady 
                    Macbeth's beauty:— <span class="inline_quote">According to my notion it is of that character which I believe is generally 
                        allowed to be most captivating to the other sex—fair, feminine, nay perhaps even 
                        fragile—

                        fair and fragile beauty she conceived, she would have used a single 
                        gesture or one inflection similar to those employed when she was 
                        representing turbulent inhuman strength.</span></span></p> <p class="tei_p tei_p_xml:id_p7">The second point of interest in Professor Bell's note is, that the 
                    melancholy and dismal blank beginning to steal on Lady Macbeth is 
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2">more the creation of Siddons than of Shakespeare</span>. There is nothing 
                    in the text to contradict it, but little to indicate it. This will become 
                    more apparent when we reach the detailed notes.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">A second notice in another copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Macbeth</span> appears as follows:—
                    
                    <span class="inline_quote">Mrs. Siddons is not before an audience. Her mind wrought up in high conception 
                        of her part, her eye never wandering, never for a moment idle, passion and 
                        sentiment continually betraying themselves. Her words are the accompaniments 
                        of her thoughts, scarcely necessary, you would imagine, to the expression, but highly 
                        raising it, and giving the full force of poetical effect.</span>
                    
                    What a tribute! Shakespeare's words hardly necessary! And this 
                    was written by a man who idolised Shakespeare.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Professor Bell elsewhere remarks:—
                        
                        <span class="inline_quote">A just observation that it is unhappy when the part of Lady Macbeth is in the 
                            hands of a Siddons, and Macbeth (with?) an inferior actor. She then becomes not 
                            the affectionate aider of her husband's ambition, but the fell monster who tempts 
                            him to transgress, making him the mere instrument of her wild and uncontrollable 
                            ambition.</span></p>

                            scene being quoted as is necessary to render the note intelligible. 
                            The text of Shakespeare is given as found in the edition annotated

                                large section of the public that the security of our dominion in India 
                                required the sacrifice, once a year, of twenty innocent natives of both 
                                sexes, with every circumstance of cruelty and indignity which could 
                                add bitterness to death; and suppose a bill were introduced into 
                                Parliament for the purpose of giving practical effect to such conclusion. 
                                How many members of Parliament would be found to vote for 
                                it? Not one, I believe. The most loyal and submissive of the

                                great a crime, even though the alternative should be the probable loss 
                                of our Indian empire. He would say to himself that the alternative 
                                supposed, though possible or even probable, was by no means certain; 
                                that the danger was perhaps, after all, not so great as had been supposed, 
                                and might perchance be altogether averted by the operation 
                                of events as yet unforeseen; but that, in any case, he must decline to 
                                have a hand in the commission of a great crime, be the political gain

                                of the inevitable fruits is the periodical torture and slaughter of 
                                '10,000 or 20,000' innocent human beings, to say nothing of other 
                                evils which are not periodical, but chronic. We are not simply to 
                                stand aloof and let matters take their course; we are to 'uphold' this 
                                periodical sacrifice to the Moloch of 'British interests,' and must 
                                accordingly interfere actively 'to prevent changes from occurring' in 
                                Turkey which would put an end to the sacrifice, if we think that such

                                ourselves. Yet so inconsistent is human nature that those who do
