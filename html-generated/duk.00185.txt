            You will see many good writers
                That(Jean Paul) Friedrich Richter
            Born 1763 at Wonsiedel in near Baireuth, (Germany)
            rather poor the earlier years, father a subordinate clergyman
            —went to the university—his father died—he
            was hard up for many years afterward.—
            Resolved to make his living by writing books—
            his first work being finished—no publisher—
            tried some time—at last found one in Berlin
            —unnoticed by the reviews, except one, and
            that gave a scornful notice.—Richter
            still holds his purpose—writes another
            work, "Selections from the papers of the Devil,""
            ransacked high and low for a publisher, but
            found none—until some years afterward—
            Stood out in costume, wore his shirt open
            at the neck, &amp;c—horrified all the "magisters"
            —held out in costume seven years, and then
            returned to orthodoxy—
            Living in the most scanty manner for
            some ten years, in 1793, when 30 years
            old, he began to be known and his works
            marketable, "the Invisible Lodge," "Hesperus"
            &amp;c. about that time. (novels.)—The Reviews
            acknowledged him, and he went on writing
            and receiving good returns.—He wrote
            many many works, (some sixty or more vols. I believe)
            He married 1798, a good wife of rather upper grade.
            Had a pension from a princely prelate, in 1802
            and continued for life.—His eldest son died 1821
            
            
            Richter continued
            Was writing on a favorite theme, Immortality,
                when (had been quite blind some years,)
                when, 14th November, 1825, he died.—
            Richter seems to have been a thoroughly
            irregular genius, according to the laws and models.
            He was gay, sparkling, a rattler, profound,
            —one of those that to new readers do not
            please, but once falling in with him, and
            reading his books, it is amply made up.—
            He seems to have "believed in Christ," and
            the orthodox tenets,. (Is this so?)—
                ☜
            His person was huge, queer, irregular.—
            He is witty, very—yet a certain true
                pathos pervades even his comeiedy.—
            I should say that he was unnatural,
            and lurid, judged by the calm and wholesome
            models.—He is full of love, and appears
            to be the originator of much of the
            soft and sentimental ways of the swarms
            of tale‑writers of the last thirty years, in
            inBritain and America.—
            
            Carlyle certainly introduced the
            German style, writers, sentimentalism,
            transcendentalism, &amp;c. &amp;c &amp;c from 1826
            to a1840—through the great Reviews
            and magazines—and through his own
            works and example.—
