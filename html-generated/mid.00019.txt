                Grier estimates that this was written between 1856 and 1860 (Walt Whitman: Notebooks and Unpublished Manuscripts, ed. Edward F. Grier [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 5:1812). These notes refer to Thomas Carlyle's essay "The Nibelungen Lied," first published in the Westminster Review in 1831, republished in Critical and Miscellaneous Essays, Centenary Edition (1838-39), 2:216-272.

        Neibelungen-leid Song of Neibelingen
        
        author unknown it is objective, like the Iliad
        Song of the
        Probably composed dates back to about the 6th of 7th century
            
            but the date when it was written as now, is the 13th century
        
        Carlyle supposes it to be about the third
        reduction (digestion) from its primitive form
        out of myths, poems acts, traditions, or what not.—
        
        Characters
        Siegfried—the hero, a warrior, king, full of
        courage—the usual type‑hero,
        as seen, duly followed, in all
        modern novels and plays.
        Chriemheld—a beautiful princess, sister
        of three kingly brothers, of Worms,
        in time Siegfrieds wife
        Gunther, the principal of the three brothers
        Brumhilde, a brave, vindictive, relentless
        woman—Gunthers wife
        Hagen, a brave warrior
        Etzel (king of Hun‑land
        Chriemhilde's second
        husband) supposed to be the
        historic Attila died
        450
        A.D.
        
        In their present shape these poems
            Heldenbuch, and Neibelungen, cannot
            be older than the twelfth century.—
        
        The poet himself is unknown—he
        probably made up the poem in the
        thirteenth century.—
