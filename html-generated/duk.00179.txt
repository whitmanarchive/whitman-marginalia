            Louis 14th, born 1638—died 1715
            Corneille  Louis 13th
            Racine toward the last of  Louis 14th 
            —Tragedies rigidly after the
            antique models—characters Greek or
            Roman—every thing on stilts—
            all the talk in heroics.—
            
            I fancy the classical tragedies
            of Corneille, Racine, Voltaire, &amp;c.
            must illustrate the vital difference
            between a native and normal growth
            (as the Greek tragedies themselves,) and
            all that comes from the mere
            study of that growth.—
            
            DecNovember 1855. I saw Rachel in
            "Athalie," at the Academy of Music
            
            Myrrha, by Alfieri, the Italian—lurid passions
            —with long‑winded dialogues between Myrrha and daughter mother
            about nothing.—
