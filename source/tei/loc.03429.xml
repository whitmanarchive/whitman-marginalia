        <p>The Judiciary Committee of the House,
            after a lengthy conference with Governor
            Green, reported in the afternoon the Australian
            Ballot Reform bill. Governor Green suggested
            a number of changes, which were
            adopted.</p>
        <p>The Senate confirmed the following nominations:
        E. O. Chapman, State Superintendent
        of Public Instruction; P.H. Daily,
        Harbor Master of Jersey City; Richard S.
        Kuhl, Law Judge of Hunterdon county;
        Evil W. Crane, Prosecutor of Essex county,
        and Karl Buttner, Law Judge of Essex
        county.</p>
        <p>The bill displacing Janitor Brown, Republican,
            passed the Senate in the afternoon by a
            party vote after a warm debate.</p>
        <p>The passage of the bill allowing the employment
            of non-residents on oyster boats was
            reconsidered.</p>

        <p>Among those present were many those

            in the final tribute to their associates of the
            Plymouth Choral Society. Short services
            were held at each of the houses in which reposed
            the body of one of the victims, and the
            choir sang their most mournful strains.</p>
        <p>Upon the conclusions of the services the remains
            were conveyed in nine hearses, followed
            by an immense throng, to Shawnee
            Cemetery, where the bodies were laid side by
            side amid the tears of the multitude.</p>
