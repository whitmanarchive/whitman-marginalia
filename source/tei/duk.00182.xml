                    <p>This little Treatise is extracted from a more extensive
                    work, undertaken without consulting my resources,
                    and long since abandoned.&#8212;The following comprises
                    the greater part of the different fragments which
                    had been written, and which seemed to me best
                    worthy; all else destroyed.&#8212;
                    (1.) Montesquieu has only spoken of positive laws,
                    leaving his splendid structure incomplete; but we must
                    go to the very source of these laws, to trace the
                    origin of this primitive implied or expressed Covenant
                    which binds all societies together.&#8212;The <hi rend="underline">Contrat Social</hi>
                    has appeared; this forms the portico of the temple,
                    and the first chapter of <hi rend="underline">L'Esprit des lois</hi>.&#8212;We may
                    say in truth of this author&#8212;"The Human Race had
                    Lost its Title Deeds&#8212;Jean <choice><sic>Jaques</sic><corr>Jacques</corr></choice> has found Them."
                    (<hi rend="underline">Note by Brissard.</hi>)</p>
                    <p>Rousseau has given the substance of

                    where traveling is discussed; and another abstract

                        <p>I wish to inquire whether, taking men as they
                        are, and laws as they may be made, some just rule
                        of administration may not be established in the
                        civil order.&#8212;In this research it will be my
                        constant endeavor to ally that which the

                        <p>I begin without expatiating.&#8212;I may be

                        <p>Man is born free, yet he is everywhere
                        in fetters.&#8212;He who fancies himself the master
                        of others is only more enslaved than they.&#8212;
                        Whence this anomaly?&#8212;I know not its cause.&#8212;
                        What can legalize it?&#8212;I think I can answer.
                        Did I only consider force, and the results arising
                        from it, I should say<del rend="overstrike">,</del>: So long as a nation

                        For all this, social order is a sacred right
                        upon which all others are based.&#8212;This right,
                        however, originates not in nature, but is founded
                        on covenants.&#8212;Now to investigate those covenants.</p></div1>

                         <p>Family organization is the oldest society
                         and the only natural one.&#8212;Yet children only
                         remain subject to the father, while they need his care.

                         independence; each is free from the other.&#8212;If
                         they still remain united it is because they
                         voluntarily elect to do so.&#8212;This common liberty
                         is a consequence of the nature of man.&#8212;
                         His first law is that of watching over his own
                         preservation.&#8212;Subsequently, the chief is the symbol

                         their liberty except for their own interests.&#8212;The 
                         sole difference is, that in the family the love of the 
                         father for the children compensates him for the

                     <p>It is doubtful, according to Grotius, whether
                         the human race belongs to a hundred men, or 
                         these hundred men belong to the human race;

                         This is also the sentiment of Hobbes.&#8212;See the
                         human species thus divided into herds of cattle,
                         each having its chief, who guards but to devour
                         it.&#8212;As a shepherd is by nature superior to his
                         flock, so the human shepherds.&#8212;Thus reasoned
                         the Emperor Caligula, according to Philon, proving
                         plausibly enough that the kings were gods, or
                         the people beasts.&#8212;</p>
                         <p>The philosophy of Caligula is revived in
                         that of Hobbes and Grotius.&#8212;Aristotle had
                         said, before them all, that men are not
                         equal by nature, but that some were born
                         for slavery, and some for dominion.&#8212;Aristotle
                         was right, but he mistook the effect for the cause.
                         Every man that is born in slavery is born for
                         slavery; nothing is more certain.&#8212;Slaves lose
                         everything in their fetters; even to the desire
                         of quitting them; they love their servitude, as
                         the companions of Ulysses loved their brutishness.
                         If there are slaves by nature, it is because
                         there have been slaves against nature.&#8212;Force
                         made the first slavery; cowardice has <choice><orig>per-<lb/>

                         Noah, the father of the three great monarchs who
                         divided the universe, like the children of Saturn,
                         whom we seem to recognize in them.&#8212;</p></div1>

                         <p>The strongest man can never be strong enough
                         to be always master, unless he transforms force
                         into right, and obedience into duty.&#8212;From
                         this arises the right of the strongest, a right
                         which is seemingly claimed in irony, but really
                         laid down as a principle.&#8212;But will they not
                         define this word for us?&#8212;Force is a physical
                         power; I cannot see what morality can result 
                         from its effects.&#8212;To yield to force is an act
                         of necessity, not will.&#8212;At the most it is an
                         act of prudence.&#8212;In what sense can this
                         be a duty?&#8212;</p>
                         <p>Let us assume this pretended right for a 
                         moment.&#8212;Nothing but inexplicable nonsense
                         results from it; as the effect changes with
                         the cause, and every force which surmounts
                         the first one, succeeds in right.&#8212;So long as
                         we can disobey successfully, we do so lawfully;
                         and, if the strongest is in the right, the only
                         point is to prove who may be the strongest.
                         Of what avail is a right which perishes when
                         force ceases?&#8212;If we must obey by force, of
                         what need is duty?</p>
                         <p>"Submit yourselves to the higher powers."
                         If this means, yield to force, the precept is a 
                         good one, but superfluous.&#8212;I answer that it
                         will never be violated.&#8212;All power comes

                         remark upon which every social system

                         destroying natural equality, the social compact,
                         on the contrary, substitu<subst><del rend="overwrite" seq="1">ting</del><add rend="overwrite" place="over" seq="2">tes</add></subst> a civil and
                         legitimate equality for the physical inequality
                         that nature has caused among men,&#8212;and
                         That, however unequal they may be in respect
                         to strength or genius, all become equalized
                         by strength, and by right.&#8212;</p>
                         <p><hi rend="underline">Note.</hi>&#8212;Under bad governments, this equality is
                         but seeming and illusory, serving only to maintain
                         the poor in their misery and the rich in
                         their usurpations.&#8212;In this case the laws
                         are always advantageous to the possessors,
                         and injurious to non-possessors.&#8212;from
                         which it follows that the social state 
                         can only be beneficial to men when 
                         all possess some, but none too much,
                         property.&#8212;</p>
