                        <p>THE WILD MEN OF BORNEO.&#8212;"At Kenansvill, 24th March, was exhibited the Wild Men of Borneo. They were two in number. About three feet high; weighed between 47 and 50 pounds. Could lift 400 pounds from the floor with ease. Age unknown; supposed to be between 30 and 40. They could not talk. Do you know any thing about them? They are said to have been caught on the island of Borneo, etc. Some contradict it, and say they were raised in this country." We have no data from which to judge, except the statements of the parties interested. We incline to the opinion that they are real Borneoans. <add rend="unmarked" place="bottom"><handShift new="#h1"/>*</add></p>
