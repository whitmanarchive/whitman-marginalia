                                And still more strikingly Othello says: "Every

                                to an extent that is suprising; we may go
                                farther and say, that is needless, and that will,
                                when mankind have at length learned to esteem
                                the man above his accidents, be very greatly restricted.

                                and sense, and who is really the superior, cowering
                                before a fellow-human whose <hi rend="italic">force</hi> consists in

                                intellectual power or manliness! A larger knowledge

                                Similar remarks might be made respecting the
                                tyranny of wealth, hereditary privilege, and official

                                that men will have learned to direct their gaze in
