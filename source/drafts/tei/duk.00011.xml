            protection of Cavaignac, the Assembly had
            indeed continued its sittings; but apart from
            the proceedings instituted in relation to the
            insurrection, the only discussion of much
            interest had been a discussion on a proposition
            of Proudhon, that the State should appropriate
            partly by way of tax, and partly by way
            of credit, a third part of all the rents of
            France, whether<note type="authorial" place="over" resp="#h1" target="#add1">&#9758;</note>of lands or houses, and a
            third part of all the interest due on capital.
            This tremendous attempt of the anarchist to
            carry his theories into actual practice had
            been put down by a universal negative.
            Thiers, on the 26th of July, had given in a
            Report of Committee unanimously reprobating
            the proposal; and on the 31st, after
            Proudhon had delivered from the tribune an
            unexampled speech in reply, in which he
            dared the Assembly single-handed, drubbed
            Thiers and the Socialists too, and attacked
            property, the validity of contracts, universal
            suffrage, and a hundred other things, he was
            met with a vote declaring his opinions to be
            odious.</p>
            <p xml:id="p1a" next="#p1b">The debates on the Constitution extended

            of it took place on the four days from

            For its intrinsic importance, as well as for

            <p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> name of Geoffrey or Geffray Chaucer,
            has a grateful sound to English ears,
            and the image which it conjures up, purified
            by time from every taint of ignoble association,
            looms large to us through the mists of
            the five centuries which intervene. We regard
            it as the "sacra et major imago" of the
            founder of that goodly fellowship of the
            gifted, which, since the dawn of <choice><orig>civilisation</orig><reg>civilization</reg></choice>,
            has been the salt and the <choice><orig>savour</orig><reg>savor</reg></choice> of our English
            life, and we cherish it, as well we may,
            with a reverent and pious affection. But
            what the image of the poet thus gains in
            grandeur it loses in distinctness, and for our
            own interest, at all events, it may well be
            questioned whether this distant and misty
            reverence is exactly the species of incense
            which it becomes us to offer to one who, during<cb/>
                <milestone unit="undeclared" rend="vertbar-full"/>
            more than half a century, within the
            range of our authentic history, was the greatest
            lay-intelligence in England, and whose
            life was perhaps as pregnant with consequences
            to our national development as that
            of any one man who ever existed in England
            at all. Would it not be more profitable
            to us, and perhaps not less acceptable to the
            shade of him, who was certainly no friend
            to unreasoning adoration, if we endeavored
            to form for ourselves something like a definite
            notion of his character both as a poet
            and as a man, and thus to place our respect
            (if such should still remain to us) on the
            firmer basis of individual knowledge? Is it
            wise to rest contented with mere hearsay
            and <choice><orig>second-hand</orig><reg>secondhand</reg></choice> information, when the question
            regards the first in point of time, and,
            in one department at least, the second in
            point of excellence of our native poets; or
            is it meet that those who would blush to
            be found tripping in the minutest details of
            classical philology, or of the modern tongues,
            should unhesitatingly confess, as they but
            too often do, their ignorance of an author,
            an acquaintance with whom, apart altogether
            from his intrinsic merits, is indispensable
            to a knowledge of the historical development
            of the language which they speak?
            Truly the object seems worthy of some slight
            effort.</p>
            <p>In order to deal with the utilitarian spirit
            which perhaps not improperly influences the
            choice of the many, in literature as in more
            vulgar matters, and to fix, as it were, the
            marketable value of Chaucer, the first question,
            as it seems to us, which we are bound
            at once to ask and to answer, is&#8212;belongs he
            to the living or to the dead; does he or does
            he not speak words of living interest to living
            men; is he or is he not an integral part
            of our existing <choice><orig>civilisation</orig><reg>civilization</reg></choice>?</p>
            <p xml:id="p3a" next="#p3b">The world is old enough to have seen
            many intellectual as well as political revolutions,
            and there are eras which boasted
            probably of no mean culture, irrevocably
            lost in the darkness of time. They are past,
            dead even in their effects&#8212;at least we can
            trace no influence which they exercise over
            our present life. Mediately they may work,
            as the <choice><orig>civilisation</orig><reg>civilization</reg></choice> of Egypt through that of

            be bound together; but the Pyramids teach
            no audible lesson except that of the mutability
            of human affairs, and the vast Sphinx
            is as silent as the sand at its base. These,

            that of an accomplished and successful civilian
            at the present day. It may make us
            think better of the liberality of our ancestors

            coated warriors and hooded monks, there
            was one who was neither a soldier nor a
            priest, who advanced himself to celebrity and
            fortune, and during a long life under three
            monarchs enjoyed both <choice><orig>honour</orig><reg>honor</reg></choice> and wealth

            live, to the almost total exclusion of the often
            much more important features of resemblance,

            estranged us from the early history
            of our country.</hi><anchor xml:id="s2"/> We are told, for instance,
            that Chaucer lived before the invention of
            printing, in times of the darkest Popish superstition,
            when men believed in alchemy
            and astrology, wore <choice><orig>armour</orig><reg>armor</reg></choice>, and fought for
            the most part with bows and arrows; and
            we immediately form to ourselves the picture
            of a barbarous and benighted age, and
            of a quaint and curious, but ignorant and
            bigoted old man, with whom we of this generation
            of light can have no species of
            sympathy or fellowship. We forget, however,
            that by drawing the picture a little
            nearer to us we should probably have discovered
            many objects of far more interesting
            contemplation in the features of resemblance
            which lie hidden behind the few fantastic
            forms of unlikeness which have attracted
            our eye in the foreground, and that, in short,

            we should not only become reconciled to the
            character of the poet himself, but we should
            discover that he lived among a people possessing
            in the highest degree those distinctive
            features, that sharp and prominent nationality
            which distinguishes the present inhabitants
            of England from every other people. We
            should discover that same joyous and exuberant
            reality, that hatred of "humbug" which
            distinguishes us now, existing alongside of
            those superstitious observances which we
            rightly attribute to that distant age, and exhibiting
            itself, as it has ever since done in
            England, in a tendency, on the part of all
            classes of the people, to attack falsehood by
            the arms of argument and ridicule, rather
            than by an ebullition of sudden violence,
            which should peril the advantages of their
            present position, to risk a positive good for a
            possible better. We should meet, in the
            morning of our English life, with that same
            spirit which now sneers in Punch and wrestles
            in the Times, awake and busy with
            Pardoner, and monk, and mendicant, and
            with all that then was vicious and absurd,

            call forth striking manifestations of individual 
            or of national peculiarities, it is in the peaceful 
            and normal condition alone that we can hope
            to analyze that infinitely complex idea which

            can detect the individual <choice><orig>colours</orig><reg>colors</reg></choice> which compose
            the variegated web of human life. In
            the hurry of a battle or the confusion of a
            political revolution, in the panic of a pestilence
            or the depression of a famine, men of
            all races, and in all ages, must manifest
            many features of resemblance, for this simple
            reason, that their actions are for the time
            under the dominion of necessity, or at all
            events of a few simple and overwhelming
            emotions; and to prove that their conduct
            had been similar in such circumstances,
            would be but to prove that they belonged to
            the common family of mankind. If their
            courage or their pusillanimity, their clemency
            or their cruelty, had been very remarkable,
            we should then indeed have the broad
            and general ideas that they were heroes or
            cowards, that they were men of mercy or men
            of blood; but as to their position on the intellectual
            or social scale, we should still be
            utterly at sea, since a barbarian may be
            generous, and poets and philosophers have
            been known who were no heroes. So long
            as the conduct of an individual is very powerfully
            influenced by the external circumstances
            which surround him at the time, it
            forms but a rude and general index to his
            character; and it is only when his actions
            proceed from the unfettered dictates of his
            reason or of his caprice, that its light becomes
            a clear and trusty guide. If we had
            heard the orders of Harold to his nobles,
            and known every circumstance of his conduct,
            and even every thought which passed
            through his mind during the battle of Hastings,
            we might have judged perhaps of the
            talents of the General, or even of the determination
            and energy of the man, but we
            should have known less of the <choice><orig>civilisation</orig><reg>civilization</reg></choice>
            either of him or of his age, than if we had
            conversed with him, as he buckled on his
            spurs for the battle, or had played the eavesdropper,
            when, in days of careless joy, he
            lingered by the side of the swan-necked
            Edith. Of all the days of Harold's life,
            perhaps the least instructive in this respect
            would have been that of the battle of Hastings.

            from Chaucer," with notes and illustrations
            and biographies without end, and
            to little good end or purpose either, so far as
            we can judge. They have failed one and
            all, for this good and simple reason, that they
            have satisfied the requirements of no class
            of readers. Tiresome to the indolent for
            whom they were intended, they in vain endeavoured
            to rival with them the attractions
            of the slightest novel of the day; useless to
            the vain-glorious, for it was impossible to
            boast of such an acquaintance with the poet
            as they conveyed; and to the better class of
            readers, the learned and serious, not holding
            out even the promise of satisfaction, they

            by the late lamented Sir Harris Nicolas,
            appended to Pickering's edition of the
            poet. Sir Harris, who belonged, as is well
            known, to the incredulous, as Godwin did to
            the credulous school of antiquarians, proceeded
            by personal inspection of the sources,
            to verify or to refute the mass of so called
            facts out of which, with the frequent aid of
            his own too fertile imagination, that latter
            enthusiast had contrived to weave what he
            was pleased to denominate his "Life of
            Chaucer." Rejecting altogether the aid of
            conjecture, in which poor Godwin had so
            freely indulged, he determined to give us a
            "Life of the Poet, founded on documentary
            evidence instead of imagination;" and it
            will be gratifying to those who, in spite of
            the secret misgivings with which they must
            often have been visited, have striven to believe
            in the existence of the first of our hero-
            men-of-letters, as Godwin had depicted
            him, when they learn that from this dry and
            rigid detail of documentary evidence, this
            great spirit of the 14th century comes out
            more than ever in the light of a great and
            revered and even prosperous man.</p>
            <p>For the benefit of those of our readers
            whose curiosity with regard to the poet may

            into which that universal incredulity, which
            he very properly adopted as the rule of his

            poet, a cloud of mystery hangs, which, as
            yet, has defied the industry of his biographers.
            All that can be asserted with safety
            is, that he was born about the year 1328,
            &#8212;that he was of Norman descent,&#8212;that his

            of London. In support of the assertion that
            he was of Norman race, besides the form of
            the name itself, which is decidedly Norman,
            we have the very important fact, which Sir
            Harris Nicolas has overlooked, of its occurring
            in two different copies of the "Battel
            Abbey Roll," or list of persons of note
            who came over to England in the train of
            the Conqueror.<ref target="#fn4">&#42;</ref> The name seems never to
            have become a common one, and it is therefore
            extremely probable that, by the father's
            side, the poet was descended from the person
            there mentioned. But the period of more
            than two centuries and a half, which had
            elapsed between the battle of Hastings and
            the birth of the poet, is far too extensive to
            warrant us in tracing any portion, either of
            his individual character,<ref target="#fn5">&#8224;</ref> or of his fortune,
            to the circumstance of his Norman origin.
            His ancestors had no doubt intermarried
            with the Saxon population among whom
            they lived, and it is highly probable that the
            blood which flowed in the veins of the poet,
            like that of the English people generally,
            was much more Saxon than Norman. At
            the period of Chaucer's birth the prejudices
            of race had already in a great measure
            given way to the more generous feeling of
            national pride; and before his death, the
            work of amalgamation, which time and a
            community of interests had begun, was completed
            by the community of antipathies

            III. and of his son. The only benefit which
            Chaucer could have derived from the Norman

            a man to value highly. "Straw for
            your gentilesse," was probably his own sentiment
            as well as that of his host; he was a
            man and an Englishman, and that was quite
            sufficient for his purpose. It is not improbable
            that our ignorance with regard to his
            origin arises in a great measure from the
            circumstance of his pedigree having occupied

            of self-gratulation nor of self-abasement; he
            was neither proud of it nor ashamed of it;
            and therefore it is that although he is very
            open and communicative with regard to the
            circumstances of his life generally, it never
            once occurs to him to say anything of the
            manner in which he was ushered into the
            world.</p>
            <p>That his parents were persons in easy, if
            not affluent circumstances, may be safely
            inferred from the fact, that he certainly
            received a most excellent education. There
            is no trace of his ever having been intended
            for the Church, and yet there is no department
            of knowledge which was then cultivated,
            with which he does not exhibit an
            intimate and apparently an old standing
            familiarity.</p>
            <p>Whatever may have been the place of
            Chaucer's birth, whether it was the city of
            London, or the county of Kent, which we
            shall afterwards see that he represented in
            Parliament, and with which there are many
            reasons to suppose that he was connected,
            there seems little doubt that he received the
            early part of his education in London. The
            fact, however, is by no means undisputed.
            The chief argument in its <choice><orig>favour</orig><reg>favor</reg></choice> is derived
            from a passage in "The Testament of
            Love," which is adduced by Godwin and
            most of Chaucer's biographers as completely
            establishing the point; whilst by Sir Harris
            Nicolas, it is with equal confidence rejected,
            as proving nothing at all. The "Testament
            of Love" is an allegorial piece, composed
            in imitation of the celebrated work of Boethius,
                <hi rend="italic">De Consolatione Philosophi&#230;</hi> but in
            which the part of "<hi rend="italic">Philosophy</hi>" is supplied
            by "<hi rend="italic">Love</hi>," who, in a female form, appears
            to converse with, and console her "Norie"
            or <hi rend="italic">alumnus</hi>. The question in dispute among
            the biographers is, as to how far this
            "Norie," this terrestrial interlocutor, may
            with safety be regarded as the poet himself;
            and whether the circumstances mentioned
            must be held to form part of the allegory, or
            may be construed as having reference to
            actual occurrences? That Godwin, with
            his habitual rashness, has endeavoured to
            make out a great deal too much, and that
            he has converted an imaginary island, in
            which the Interlocutor is imprisoned by
            the allegorical personages, "Luste,"
            "Thought," and "Will," into the Tower
            of London, in which he conceives the poet
            to be confined by the opponents of John of
            Gaunt, is beyond dispute; still it by no
            means follows, that, because Godwin has
            made an absurd blunder wtih regard to one
            passage, no part of the book shall be held<cb/>
                <milestone unit="unknown" rend="vertbar-full"/>
            to have a personal reference to the poet;
            or that, because Chaucer does <hi rend="italic">not mean</hi> the
            "Tower of London" when he speaks of an
            "allegorical island," therefore he <hi rend="italic">does</hi> mean
            the "city of London." The passage itself
            is so pointed, that we cannot think of torturing
            it into any other than its natural
            sense. "Also the Citye of London, that is
            to me so dere, and swete, in whiche I was
            forth growen, and more kindely love have
            I to that place, than to any other in yerth,
            as every kindly creature hath full appetite
            to that place of his kindly engendure, and
            to wilne rest and pece in that stede to
            abide." The context is no doubt very
            obscure, but there is nothing in it, so far as
            we can see, which forbids the application
            of these words to the individual situation
            of Chaucer; and we are further confirmed
            in this opinion by the fact that, in the work
            of Boethius, the author continually speaks
            through the mouth of the terrestrial interlocutor.
            The probabilities, therefore, in
            our opinion, are in <choice><orig>favour</orig><reg>favor</reg></choice> of the direct construction,
            and consequently, of Chaucer's
            having been, if not born, at least "forth
            growen," in London, though we should
            scarcely have expected to find them giving
            rise to the Chapter on his "Schoolboy
            Amusements" which we find in Godwin.</p>
            <p xml:id="p7a" next="#p7b">Each of the English Universities lays
            claim to Chaucer as a pupil, with about
            equal success. That he must have studied
            at one of them is certain, for there then existed
            no other means of procuring the instruction
            which he possessed; and the
            method of solving the mystery, at which Sir
            H. Nicolas scouts, viz., by supposing that
            he was at both, seems to us by no means so
            absurd as he imagines. We know that it
            was then very common for celebrated teachers,
            both in England and on the Continent,
            to collect around them audiences drawn from
            every corner of Europe, and the students
            were a migratory population, who remained
            at any one University no longer than was
            requisite to attend on the instructions of him
            whose fame had brought them thiter. Leland,
            the English Antiquary of the sixteenth
            century, who asserts that Chaucer was at
            Oxford, was a member of both Universities,
            and Chaucer seems to indicate a <choice><orig>favour</orig><reg>favor</reg></choice> for
            the custom, where he says, that "Sondry
            scoles maken subtil clerkes." The English
            Universities had not then, and did not assume
            till long afterwards, that peculiar character
            which now belongs to them. They resembled
            the Universities of Paris and Bologna
            then, and of Germany and Scotland now;
            and we know that the custom of residing at</p>-->

            <span rend="bracket-left" hand="#h1" xml:id="s23" from="#s23" to="#s24"/><p>It is also asserted, on still more doubtful
            authority, that Chaucer studied the law; and
            an amusing anecdote is told by Spight, of
            his having been fined two shillings for beating
            a Franciscan friar in Fleet-street, whilst
            he was a member of the Inner Temple.
            We are further told that he <choice><orig>travelled</orig><reg>traveled</reg></choice> in
            France for his instruction. But with reference
            to all of these assertions, the question<anchor xml:id="s24"/>
            will naturally arise, whether they were not
            brought forward by their authors, in order
            to account for the acquirements of which
            the poet was no doubt possessed when he
            first comes within the range of historical
            <span rend="singleLine-left" xml:id="s25" from="#s25" to="#s26"/>vision. If a man knows French well, as he
            seems to have done, it is no doubt highly
            probable that he may have been partially
            educated in France; but it is not a sufficient
            ground upon which to assert that such has
            actually been the case, since the fact would<anchor xml:id="s26"/>
            be equally well accounted for by his mother
            having been a French woman, or a hundred
            other accidental circumstances.</p>
            <p>All that can be positively affirmed of
            Chaucer up to the year 1359, when he was
            in the army which invaded France, and
            when, according to the date which is usually
            given to his birth, he must have been 31
            years of age, is that he received the best
            education which could be obtained at the
            time, and that he probably was intended for
            a learned profession, since his studies would
            not otherwise have been carried so far at a
            time when learning was so rarely cultivated
            by laymen for its own sake.</p>
            <p>The account which we possess of his first
            and only military service, is contained in a
            deposition which he himself gave on the 15th
            October 1387, as a witness for Sir Richard
            le Scrope, in <choice><orig>defence</orig><reg>defense</reg></choice> of his right to the arms
            "azure a bend or" against the claim of Sir
            R. Grosvenor. Chaucer was then attending
            upon Parliament, as knight of the shire for
            the county of Kent. His deposition, which
            is extremely curious, we shall insert for the

            in what capacity Chaucer actually served
            in this memorable expedition. The term
            "armed" by no means sets the question at

            the deposition, when he was certainly altogether
            a civilian. Perhaps it referred
            merely to the rank of esquire, which he

            office is elsewhere called; and on the 20th
            June 1367, the king grants him, by the
            designation of "dilectus Vallettus noster,"<note type="authorial" resp="#h1" place="right"><milestone unit="undeclared" rend="horbar-short-center"/>

            of any payment to him appears on the Issue
            Roll of the exchequer, so that he probably
            held during that time no <choice><orig>recognised</orig><reg>recognized</reg></choice> public

            with the Court, and nothing is more likely
            than that they may have stretched back to

            prisoner, of course, proves nothing, for this
            might have befallen a civil as well as a
            military servant of the king, though it is
            very possible that the captivity which he

            services; and that its duration may account

            the "Battel Abbey Roll" in his behalf.</p>
            <p>Chaucer's marriage is probably to be
            ascribed to the period at which we have now
            arrived. His wife was Philippa Roet, one
            of the "demoiselles," or ladies in attendance
            on the queen, and the eldest daughter of Sir
            <note type="authorial" resp="#h1" place="left">married

            of arms of Guienne. She was also the
            sister of Katherine, the widow of Sir Hugh
            Swynford, who at one time was the mistress,
            and afterwards became the wife of John of
            Gaunt. This, like most of the other facts
            of Chaucer's life, has been the subject of
            dispute, but we may now regard it as finally
            set at rest, by the investigations of Sir Harris
            Nicolas. The exact period of his marriage
            is not mentioned, but it must have taken
            place before the 12th September, 1366, since
            on that day a pension of ten merks annually,
            for life, was granted to "Philippa <hi rend="italic">Chaucer</hi>

                Angli&#230;." Chaucer's wife was, therefore,
            a <hi rend="italic">Domicella</hi> before he was, or at least
            is known to have been, a <hi rend="italic">Vallettus</hi>, and it is
                not improbable that his <choice><orig>connexion</orig><reg>connection</reg></choice> with her
            may have led to his procuring that office.
            Philippa, after her marriage with the poet,
            continued in the service of the queen, and at
            Christmas 1368, she is mentioned as one of
            the persons of the royal household to whom
            robes were ordered to be given. Her name
            occurs along with those of twelve other
            "damoiselles," eight "sous damoiselles,"
            and several "veilleresses" of the queen's
            chamber, and among these latter is Philippa
            Pycard, the person whom several of the
            biographers suppose to have been the wife
            of Chaucer. There is reason to believe that
            Sir Payne Roet came to England in the retinue
            of Queen Philippa, in 1328, and it is
            therefore probable that his daughter entered
            the royal household at an early period of life.
            We have no means of ascertaining her age
            when she was united to the poet, but unless
            the marriage took place some time before the
            pension was assigned to her, her husband
            must have been at least thirty-five, and
            as it is not likely that she was much older,
            we may conclude that she was born after
            her father's arrival in England.</p>
            <p>After the queen's death, in 1369, Philippa
            Chaucer was attached to the person of Constance<cb/>
                <milestone unit="undeclared" rend="vertbar-full"/>
            of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster, the
            second consort of John of Gaunt, to whose
            children, by his first alliance, her younger
            sister, Katherine, Lady Swinford, was then
            governess. Like her husband, she seems to
            have enjoyed the <choice><orig>favour</orig><reg>favor</reg></choice> of "the great duke,"
            for, before August 1372, he had given her a
            pension of &#163;10 per annum, which was commuted,
            in June 1374, for an annuity of the
            same amount to her and her husband for life,
            "in consideration of the good services which
            they had rendered to the duke, to his duchess,
            and to the late queen, his mother." In
            1382, the Duke of Lancaster presented her
            with a silver-gilt cup and cover, as a new
            year's gift, and the record of his donation
            shows that she was then one of the three
            ladies in attendance on the duchess, the
            others being Lady Sanche Blount and Lady
            Blanche de Trumpington.</p>
            <p>Such is pretty nearly all that has been
            discovered of her who shared the joys and
            the sorrows of Chaucer, and who, as we
            shall see, was the mother of his children.
            We would gladly know more, but on this,
            as on many other occasions, we must feel
            grateful for knowledge which, though

            that which we possess of the private history

            he obtained the usual letters of protection,
            in order that he might go abroad in the
            service of the king. This, so far as we

            <note xml:id="fn6" type="authorial" place="bottom" resp="#h2">&#42;As regards Chaucer's relation to the gentler sex
            in general, there is one passage in his writings which
            deserves to be noticed. In the Prologue to the
            "Rime of Sire Thopas," the host, when speaking of
            the poet, says,&#8212;
            <q who="Chaucer"><lg type="linegroup" rend="centered"><l>"This were a popet in an arme to embrace</l>

            And from this, which was the opinion of himself, by a
            man not remarkable for vanity, taken in conjunction
            with what we know of his marriage, it may be inferred
            with little danger of error, that fortune, along with
            her other <choice><orig>favours</orig><reg>favors</reg></choice>, dealt to him no stinted share of
            womanly affection, and that, in common with most of

            more enviable privilege of being greatly beloved.</note>

            parts <hi rend="italic">at least seven times</hi><ref target="#fn7">&#42;</ref> in the public
            service. The second of these missions is
            the most celebrated, from his referring to an
            anecdote supposed to be connected with it in
            the Canterbury Tales. The commission
            for this embassy was dated on the 12th of
            November, 1372, and Chaucer being then
            one of the king's esquires, was joined in it
            with James Pronam and John de Mari,
            citizens of Genoa, for the purpose of choosing
            some port in England where the Genoese
            might form a commercial establishment.
            It seems that he went to Florence, as well
            as Genoa, for on his return, in February,
            1374, he received a payment at the Exchequer
            for his expenses while on the king's
            service at these places. <span rend="bracket-right" hand="#h1" xml:id="s27" from="#s27" to="#s28"/>Godwin, and several
            of the other biographers, assert, that on this

            obtained from him, then and there, the
            pathetic tale of Griselda.<anchor xml:id="s28"/> The anecdote,
            which, if true, would be highly interesting,
            unfortunately rests upon no higher authority
            than the possibility that such a meeting may
            have taken place, and the supposed allusion
            to it in the following lines in the Prologue
            to the Clerk's Tale:&#8212;</p>

            <p>If Chaucer had not appeared in his own
            person as one of the characters in the Pilgrimage,
            and recited one of the tales, there
            would then have been very strong reasons
            for identifying his character with that of the
            Clerk of Oxenford, and the internal evidence
            in <choice><orig>favour</orig><reg>favor</reg></choice> of this interesting meeting
            might have sufficed to supply the deficiency
            of external proof. As it is, however, notwithstanding
            the fact of Chaucer's having
            actually been at Florence while Petrarch
            was at Arqua (for the discovery of which
            we are indebted to Sir Harris Nicolas, and
            which, if it had been known to Godwin,
            would have been pounced upon as a positive
            windfall,) we cannot regard the story in a
            higher light than that in which Sir Harris
            puts it when he says, that "until accident
            brings some hitherto undiscovered document

            doubtful circumstances in the lives of eminent
            men which their admirers wish to
            believe true, but for which their biographers
            ought to require surer evidence than what
            Godwin calls 'coincidences which furnish a
            basis of historical probability.'"</p>
            <p>Our space does not permit us to enumerate
            the subsequent diplomatic services of
            the poet. They were all of them, however,
            on affairs of importance, and frequently
            of secrecy, which renders it difficult to
            trace their object, or even to ascertain their
            number, as on these occasions neither commissions
            nor letters of protection were given,
            and the fact of their having taken place is
            only ascertained by payments to Chaucer
            from the Exchequer for services rendered
            "in secretis negotiis domini regis." One,
            however, is mentioned by Froissart, in
            which Chaucer was joined in February,
            1377, with Sir Guichard d'Angle (afterwards
            Earl of Huntingdon) and Sir Richard
            Sturry, to negotiate a secret treaty for the
            marriage of Richard, Prince of Wales, with
            Mary, daughter of the King of France. On
            most of these occasions, as on that to which
            we have just alluded, he was associated
            with persons of more exalted rank&#8212;a circumstance
            which has led Saunders to form
            the very natural conjecture that he was in
            truth the working man of the embassy, and
            acted in the capacity of what would now
            be called charg&#233; d'affaires.<ref target="#fn8">&#42;</ref></p>
            <p>But another and much more prosaic occupation
            engaged the attention of the poet
            when in England. On the 8th June 1374,
            shortly after his return from his first mission
            to Italy, he was appointed Comptroller of the
            Customs, and Subsidy of "Wools, Skins,
            and tanned Hides," in the port of London,
            and this office he continued to hold for twelve
            years, though he was bound to write the
            rolls of his office with his own hand, to be
            continually present, and to perform his duties
            personally and not by deputy, excepting
            of course the occasions on which he was
            sent abroad in the King's service. On the
            8th May 1382, he was farther appointed
            Comptroller of the Petty Customs in the port
            of London, but the duties of this latter office
            he was permitted to discharge either in person
            or by sufficient deputy, and on the 17th
            of the following February, he was accordingly
            permitted to appoint a permanent
            deputy. It is amusing to remark, in <choice><orig>connexion</orig><reg>connection</reg></choice>

            <note xml:id="fn8" place="bottom" type="authorial" resp="#h2">&#42; It is worthy of remark, that in 1378, when he

            for life, to be received in the port of London
            by the hands of the King's butler. Perhaps
            his royal master may have been of opinion
            that after a day spent in those "reckenynges,"
            of which he gently insinuates his aversion
            in his House of Fame, a "cup of sack"
            would be no unwelcome refreshment to a
            poet.</p>
            <p>But though we may imagine that the
            kindness of his sovereign may have been
            called into exercise on this occasion, by a

            occupations, we can by no means join with
            Tyrwhitt in his lamentation for the genius

            much of that peculiarly healthy and normal

            charged with more than its own share in the

            House may claim the merit of having saved
            Charles Lamb from the heaviest of human
            afflictions. We regard it as a proof at once
            of the "manysidedness" of Chaucer's mental
            endowments, and of the thorough manliness
            of his character, that whilst he acted as

            a very ingenious and romantic story
            of his having taken part in the dispute
            between the Court and the citizens of London,
            respecting the election of a certain
            mayor of the name of John of Northampton;
            of his having fled to Zealand; of his there
            having acted with great liberality to his
            fellow-exiles; of the persons who had charge

            their trust and reduced him to poverty; of
            his having betrayed his confederates in return,
            in order to get out of the Tower of

            on his return, and a great many circumstances
            of a similar description, which,
            though highly creditable to the inventor,
            would not probably be greatly to the edification
            of our readers. The whole of this mass

            whole time of his supposed exile, Chaucer
            was quietly discharging his Custom-House
            duties in London and drawing his salaries;
            and that, at the very time when he is supposed
            to have been lying a prisoner in the
            Tower of London, he was sitting as Knight
            of the Shire for the county of Kent in the
            Parliament at Westminster! The discovery
            is of course a notable one, and Sir Harris
            Nicolas glorifies himself accordingly. But
            the odd part of the business is, that although
            he has thus pulled down the whole of the
            superincumbent mass of rubbish which
            Godwin had built upon the theory of the
            dismissal, he still continues to be haunted by
            the theory itself. Why does it never occur
            to him, that if Chaucer became a Member of
            Parliament on the 1st October, and ceased
            to be Comptroller of the Customs on the 1st
            December, the two events may possibly
            have been connected, and that the resignation
            of the comptrollership may have been
            occasioned by its duties being incompatible
            with those of a member of Parliament? The
            explanation seems so natural, that one wonders
            why it should have failed to suggest
            itself. But what, then, became of the theory
            of the dismissal? It went by the board of
            course; and this Sir Harris would by no
            means permit, for he (in common with
            Godwin, strange to tell) was determined
            that Chaucer should be poor at one period
            of his life; and the present seemed a <choice><orig>favourable</orig><reg>favorable</reg></choice>
            opportunity for commencing his misfortunes.

                been <choice><orig>favourable</orig><reg>favorable</reg></choice> to him at first, from the
            power which it placed in the hands of his
            patron, the Duke of Lancaster, the tide had
            <!--NHG: there is a dot next to this line that may be a stray mark.-->now turned against him, and that he had
            become obnoxious to the Duke of Gloucester,
            who had then risen into power. For this
            there is just as little proof as for the exile to
            Zealand. It is very possible that a change
            of ministers may have led to the poet's retirement
            from his offices in the Customs, and
            a similar circumstance may have induced
            him voluntarily to assign his pensions&#8212;a
            transaction which has been held as a sure
            indication of his being in pecuniary difficulties.
            In any view of this matter, the facts
            seem to us by no means necessarily to infer
            poverty; they are equally explicable on the
            supposition of his having attained to such
            affluence as to render it no longer indispensable
            that he should discharge the functions
            of laborious offices; and however improbable
            it may be that a poet should be industrious,
            if we have the industry proved, as in
            the case before us, we think the supposition
            of its having been followed by its usual concomitant
            of easy circumstances, even in his
            case, ceases to be extravagant. The death
            of his wife, moreover, which seems to have
            taken place in 1387, by adding the element
            of domestic affliction to the other inducements
            which must always have weighed
            with a man of letters, renders the voluntary
            withdrawal of Chaucer from public affairs,
            at this period of his life, still more intelligible.
            We are confirmed in our opinion,
            moreover, by the fact, that he never again
            held any public office the duties of which he
            was compelled to discharge in person. In
            1389, when the young king Richard II. assumed
            the reins of government, and the
            poet's patron, John of Gaunt, and his son,
            the Earl of Derby, (afterwards King Henry
            IV.,) came into power, he was appointed to
            the valuable office of Clerk of the King's
            Works at the Palace of Westminster and
            the other Royal Residences, but his duties
            he was permitted to discharge by deputy,
            and, even if he had not, they were probably
            more to his taste than those of Comptroller
            of Customs. This situation Chaucer held
            for two years; and the cause of his resignation,
            or dismissal, as in the former case,
            is unknown. For a short time he seems to
            have had no other pension than that which
            he derived from the Duke of Lancaster, and
            his wages as one of the King's Esquires.
            But on the 28th February 1394, he again
            obtained a grant from the King of &#163;20 for
            life; and this fact, taken in <choice><orig>connexion</orig><reg>connection</reg></choice> with
            the powerful friendships which we know he<cb/>
                <milestone unit="unknown" rend="vertbar-full"/>
            possessed, and the very recent period at
            which, as Clerk of the Works, he must have
            been very well off, renders it, to our thinking,
            rather a hasty conclusion on the part of
            his biographers, that he must have been in
            great want of money, merely because he
            seems, once or twice, to have anticipated his
            pension at the Exchequer. The truth of
            the matter probably is, that he made the
            Exchequer serve him in some measure as a
            banker&#8212;that he treated his pension as an
            account-current, upon which he drew as he
            found occasion for his ordinary expenses;
            and this view we think is confirmed by the
            fact, that he allowed it to lie after the term
            of payment, nearly as often as he drew it in
            advance. On the whole, we conceive that
            the attempt to make Chaucer a martyr to
            the world's forgetfulness of men of genius,<note type="authorial" resp="#h1" place="right">wife
            died
            1387</note>
            has not very well prospered in the hands of
            his biographers; and we think it not unlikely,
            that the phantom of poverty with which they
            have insisted on marring his fortunes, may
            have been conjured up by that which overshadowed
            their own. On this subject Sir
            Harris Nicolas is quite as pathetic as Godwin;
            and the similarity of his fate, which
            we have recently had occasion to deplore,
            with that which so long pressed upon the
            indiscreet but gifted author of Caleb Williams,
            may not improbably have brought
            about this solitary coincidence. Nor are
            we at all shaken in our opinion on this subject
            by Chaucer's address "to his Emptie
            Purse," which has been relied on as an additional
            proof of his poverty. It is manifestly
            a sportive production, written for the
            purpose of bringing his claims for an increase
            to his pensions in a light and graceful
            manner before the young king, Henry IV.,
            the son of his patron, John of Gaunt, and
            with whom, be it remembered, he was then
            nearly connected by marriage, and in these
            circumstances the expressions, "I am sorrie
            now that ye be light," "be heavy againe,"
            &#38;c., seem to us nothing more than what we
            daily hear from persons in very easy circumstances.
            They might be brought forward
            as a proof of his avarice, quite as well
            as of his poverty. But if he was a needy,
            he seems not to have been an unsuccessful
            suitor, for we know that within four days
            after Henry came to the throne, and probably
            the very day that he received the verses
            in question, he doubled the poet's pension,
            and on the 15th of October of the preceding
            year, just at that time when his supposed
            penury must have been at its height, he obtained
            in addition to his daily pitcher, another
            grant of a tun of wine every year during his
            life, "in the port of London, from the King's</p>

            for his consumption in the article of wine.
            That Chaucer was extravagant, or at least
            that he possessed those expensive tastes
            which so frequently accompany intellectual
            refinement, is extremely probable, and if
            such were the case it is not unlikely that his
            purse was occasionally "lighter" than was
            consistent with his habits; but we rejoice to
            think that there is no reason for quarrelling
            with the buxom age in which he lived, on
            the score of his having been subjected to
            actual want, and so far are we from wishing
            to claim for him the glories of pecuniary
            martyrdom, that we confess to regarding
            with some degree of pleasure, the many indications
            of wealth and comfort with which at
            every stage of his life we find him surrounded.
            We remember that Knox had "his
            pipe of Bordeaux in that old Edinburgh
            house of his," and we remember also the
            flagon of Einbecker beer, which the kind
            hands of Duke Erich proffered to Doctor
            Martin Luther, on his exit from the <hi rend="italic">Saale</hi>
            at Worms, and he gratitude with which he
            drank it; and neither the one nor the other
            of these hero-priests is one whit the less
            heroic in our eyes from his hearty enjoyment
            of the good things which Providence
            sent him. We have every reason to believe
            that the father of our poet was considerably
            more fortunate in external circumstances
            than either of the Reformers, and we have
            no reason to doubt that his enjoyments were
            tempered with the same kindly and pious
            spirit.</p>
            <p>But Chaucer was not destined long to
            enjoy the bounty of his new sovereign, for
            he died at the mature age of 72, on the 15th
            October 1400, only one year subsequent to
            the grants which we have last mentioned.
            He died in the vicinity of Westminster, in
            a house which on the Christmas Eve preceding
            he had rented from a monk of the
            name of Robert Humodesworth. Whether
            London was then the place of his habitual
            residence, whether he possessed, as has been
            said, the castle and manor of Donington, in
            Berkshire, or passed the latter part of his
            life at a <choice><orig>favourite</orig><reg>favorite</reg></choice> retreat at Woodstock,

            a few months subsequent to this grant, if not at the
            very time, the King's chief butler was none other than
            the poet's own son, Thomas Chaucer.</note>

            considerably greater industry has been bestowed
            upon the inquiry than in the eyes of
            many it may seem to merit.</p>
            <p>In his family Chaucer was not less fortunate
            than in the other circumstances of his
            life, and his name was preserved in <choice><orig>honour</orig><reg>honor</reg></choice>
            among the living by his eldest son Thomas
            Chaucer, who externally was a more important
            personage than even the poet himself.
            In the reign of Richard II., while his
            father yet lived, he had held the office of
            King's chief butler, and a grant of twenty
            marks a year had also been given to him.
            Under Henry IV, he held many lucrative
            and <choice><orig>honourable</orig><reg>honorable</reg></choice> appointments; he represented
            Oxfordshire in eight Parliaments, commencing
            with the year 1402, and coming
            down to 1429, and in 1414 he was chosen
            Speaker of the Commons of the Parliament
            that met at Westminster, on Monday after
            the octaves of St. Martin. Thomas Chaucer
            married Matilda, the second daughter and
            co-heiress of Sir John Burghersh, with whom
            he acquired large estates in Oxfordshire,
            and in many other counties, and latterly he
            seems to have been very wealthy, since he
            is rated after his death, in the list which was
            prepared of those of whom it was proposed
            to borrow money for carrying on the French
            war, at a much larger sum than any other
            person except the Bishops of Exeter and
            Ely, the Dean of Lincoln, and Sir John
            Cornwall. He served with the King in
            France with a retinue of twelve men-at-arms,
            and thirty-seven archers, and he was present
            at the battle of Agincourt. Like his father
            he seems also to have had a talent for diplomacy,
            for he was frequently employed as
            an ambassador during the reigns of Henry
            IV., Henry V., and Henry VI.</p>
            <p xml:id="p14a" next="#p14b">Thomas Chaucer had only one child,
            Alice Chaucer, who married for the third
            time, in 1430, William de la Pole, Earl, and
            afterwards Duke of Suffolk, who was attainted
            and beheaded in 1450. By him she had
            three children, the eldest of whom, John de
            la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, married the Princess
            Elizabeth Plantagenet, sister of King
            Edward IV., by whom he had a numerous
            family, the eldest of whom, John de la Pole,
            was declared by Richard III. heir-apparent
            to the throne, in the event of the Prince of
            Wales dying without issue; so that for some
            time, as Sir Harris Nicholas remarks, there
            was a great probability of the poet's great-
            great-grandson succeeding to the Crown.
            But the Earl of Lincoln (for such he had
            been created in his father's lifetime) was
            killed in the not very glorious battle of
            Stoke in 1487, and in his person the family</p>

            the fate which strangely enough seems to
            impend over the families of all our poets.</p>
            <p>Besides his son Thomas, Chaucer probably
            had a daughter and also a sister of the
            name of Elizabeth, since two persons bearing
            the name of Elizabeth Chaucer became
            nuns, one in the Abbey of Berking in Essex,
            and the other in the priory of St. Helen's,
            London, in such circumstances as to lead to
            the supposition that they were connected
            with the Poet.</p>
            <p>But of all his children, the most interesting,
            because apparently the best beloved, is
            "lytel Lowys," for whose instruction he
            compiled, and to whom he dedicated his
            "Conclusions of the Astrolabie" in a style
            so quaint, so tender, and withal so instructive
            with reference both to his own character
            and to the time, that though intended for no
            other purpose than to facilitate the studies
            of a child ten years old, it has become to us
            one of the most interesting of his works.</p>
            <p>The object of the treatise is to reduce to
            a simpler form the rules for the use of this
            instrument, which, till the invention of the
            quadrant, was invariably used both in astronomy
            and navigation, and to present them
            in English to his son, instead of the Latin in
            which it was then the custom to teach them,
            "for latine ne canst thou nat yet but smale,
            my litel sonne." It is "compowned," as he
            tells us, "after the latitude of Oxenforde,"
            where it is probable that "lytel Lowys"
            was then at school, and where his father had
            evidently perceived with delight the opening
            of powers which we have reason to believe
            were not destined to arrive at maturity.
            With a mixture of fondness and of pride
            which is touching, he says, "I perceive by
            certain evidences, thyne abylytee to lern
            scyences, touching nombres, and proporcions,
            and also well consider I thy besye

            the quaint modesty with which he lays aside
            all pretensions to scientific originality, and
            for the patriotic enthusiasm with which he
            speaks of the English language:&#8212;</p>

            <p>This little tribute of paternal love on the
            part of our poet, is indeed remarkable in
            many ways, and if we consider the time at
            which it was written, when universality of
            knowledge was of much less easy attainment
            than in our day, and bear in mind further,
            that it was the fruit of the leisure hours of
            one, who beside his literary <choice><orig>labours</orig><reg>labors</reg></choice>, which
            were neither few nor small, was as we have
            seen a courtier, a diplomatist, and a man of
            business, it will hold as such a prominent
            place among the curiosities of literature.
            Of its bearing in another point of view, we
            shall have to speak in a subsequent page.</p>
            <p xml:id="p15a" next="#p15b">We have now concluded what we conceived
            it needful to say of the external position
            of Chaucer, and of his varied career,
            and it will probably be admitted that we
            <span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h1" xml:id="s41" from="#s41" to="#s42"/>have in some measure fulfilled the promise
            with which we commenced the recital. We
            have called from the fourteenth century as
            a witness to its manners, one who neither
            in his occupations, nor in his fortunes, differed
            greatly from hundreds of the best class
            of Englishmen of the present time, and
            whose story, in its external aspect, might
            be told of many under the reign of Queen
            Victoria, as well as under that of King Edward
            III. Are we to conclude from this,
            that Chaucer was a solitary and isolated
            character, plucked as it were by anticipation
            from the realm of the future, and sent as a
            spectator for our behoof into the halls of our
            ancestors? or are we to accept him as a
            specimen of the men of his time, at the expense
            of foregoing all our preconceived
            opinions with reference to the character of
            the fourteenth century? On either hypothesis
            we should be equally in error; solitary
            and isolated he certainly was not, for
            with all that was acted, and all that was
            thought, he was entwined; in his life and
            in his character he was the expression of
            his time; but neither was he an average
            specimen, for he was its highest expression;
            we do not say that he was before his time,
            for though the phrase is often used with reference
            to those whose <choice><orig>developement</orig><reg>development</reg></choice> surpasses
            that of their contemporaries not in
            kind but in degree, we do not think that it is

            we might apply it, it would be to Wycliffe,
            and not to Chaucer. Chaucer did not anticipate
            the future, but he comprehended the
            present, he was a "seer" of what was&#8212;not
            of what was to be. He was the "clear and
            conscious" man of his time. In his opinions
            there was nothing which others did not feel,
            but what they felt unconsciously he thought
            and expressed, and what to them was a <choice><orig>vapour</orig><reg>vapor</reg></choice>,
            <span rend="singleLine-left" hand="#h1" xml:id="s45" from="#s45" to="#s46"/>to him was a form. There was no
            antagonism between him and his age, and
            hence the popularity which we know that
            he enjoyed. In taking this view of the
            matter, it may be thought that we give up
            all pretension on the part of our poet, to the
            highest&#8212;the prophetic part of the poetic
            character. We answer that we are not
            here to discuss the question, as to whether
            the proper function of the poet is to express
            the age in which he lives, or to shadow forth
            an age which is to follow.<anchor xml:id="s46"/> We state the
            <anchor xml:id="s44"/>fact as we conceive it to be, and so important
            do we regard it in order to a just appreciation
            of the character and influence of
            Chaucer, that we shall take the liberty of
            illustrating it by tracing it out as well as
            we may, first in his philosophy, and then in
            his religion.</p>
            <p>For this purpose it is not necessary that
            we should speak at length of his metaphysical
            creed, for the philosophy of Aristotle
            was still all-prevalent; and there is abundant
            proof in many parts of his writings that
            Chaucer, like the rest of the learned of his
            day, was brought up at the feet of the Stagyrite,
            and that he read it with the light which
            the Schoolmen afforded. It is probable also
            that the study was a very <choice><orig>favourite</orig><reg>favorite</reg></choice> one with
            him, that he "hadde unto logic long ygo," and
            that in this, as in many other respects, he
            painted his own character in that of the
            "Clerk of Oxenford," when he says, that
            <q who="Chaucer"><lg type="linegroup"><l>"him was liever han at his bed's head</l>
            <l>A twenty bookes cloth'd in black or red</l>

                <l>Than rob&#232; rich, or fiddle, or psaltry."</l></lg></q>
            But there is no reason to think that in this
            department Chaucer ever assumed a higher
            position than that of a recipient. In none
            of his works that have come down to us does
            he deal with the pure intelligence; and, indeed,
            from his whole character, it is obvious
            that his interest in the concrete was so intense
            as scarcely to admit of his lingering
            long in the regions of metaphysical or logical
            abstraction. The part of our nature with
            which he was concerned, and upon which it
            was his vocation to act, was precisely that
            which the logician excludes from his view;<cb/>
                <milestone unit="undeclared" rend="vertbar-full"/>
            as a poet, he had to deal with man not as he
            thinks merely, but as he feels and acts&#8212;
            with his passions and affections even more
            than with his intelligence, and hence his
            devotion to ethical studies.</p>
            <p xml:id="p16a" next="#p16b">Of the manner in which he studied, and
            <choice><orig>endeavoured</orig><reg>endeavored</reg></choice> to elaborate this latter department
            of mental philosophy, we are fortunately
            enabled to judge with considerable
            precision. In early life he translated the
            celebrated work of Boethius "De Consolatione
            Philosophi&#230;;" a book more remarkable
            for its fortunes than even for its merits.
            Composed in prison when accused of the
            crime of having "hoped for the restoration
            of Roman liberty," by him whom Gibbon
            has characterized as "the last of the Romans
            whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged
            for their countryman," it formed
            as it were the connecting link between the
            classical and the Christian world; and the
            <choice><orig>labour</orig><reg>labor</reg></choice> of translation which Chaucer performed,
            had already occupied the leisure of
            Alfred, and was yet to engage that of Elizabeth.
            Though Boethius was a Christian,
            and his quarrel with Theodoric is supposed
            to have arisen from a treatise which he published
            during his Consulship in 522, in which
            he maintained the doctrine of the Unity of
            the Trinity, in opposition to the Arian tenets
            of his master, the arguments by which he
            seems to have consoled himself for the loss
            of his greatness, and to have prepared himself
            for the death which he soon after suffered,
            are deduced from the doctrines of
            Plato, of Aristotle, and, above all, of Zeno,
            rather than from those of Christ and his disciples;
            and if the book is to be regarded in
            a higher light than that of a philosophical
            pastime, by which he sought to relieve the
            tedium of captivity, it must be viewed as
            the production of one in whom the character
            of the heathen philosopher preponderated
            over that of the Christian martyr. It possesses,
            however, much of the calm and dignified
            beauty which the ancients shed over
            their natural religion. In many passages
            we feel as if we were reading a Latin translation
            of one of the Dialogues of Plato, or
            had stumbled by accident on an unknown
            passage of one of Cicero's philosophical treatises;
            but the freshness is gone, the clearness
            and precision is wanting, the style is
            verbose, and the argument inconsequent,
            and we arrive at last at the conclusion, that
            the author intended it as an imitation of
            those writings with which we know, from
            <span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h1" xml:id="s47" from="#s47" to="#s48"/>his early studies, that he must have been
            conversant. Be this as it may, the work
            enjoyed a popularity, and exerted an influence
            over the better minds of the Middle
            Ages, beyond that of any other writer&#8212;a</p><anchor xml:id="s48"/>

            attended the philosophy of the Stoics is
            worthy of remark as illustrating the influence
            which Boethius exerted on the Middle
            Age. <hi rend="underline" hand="#h1">Wherever their tenets appear, it is
            continually as a vain protest against existing

            recovery, but the rival which was to supplant
            her listened with eagerness to the lessons
            to which she was deaf, and the stern
            philosophy of the porch found an expression
            in the energy and simplicity of Roman life.</hi>
            During the youth and <choice><orig>vigour</orig><reg>vigor</reg></choice> of the Republic,
            Stoicism was peculiarly the philosophy
            of Rome, <choice><orig>recognised</orig><reg>recognized</reg></choice> in theory and illustrated
            in practice; and it was not till virtue
            herself had departed under the relaxing and
            deadening influence of the empire, that it
            ceased to be regarded. But here, as in
            Greece, when corruption and effeminacy
            had reached their culminating point, it reappeared
            in the shape of a warning spirit, and
            though the words of Boethius, like those of
            Zeno, fell unheeded on the ears of his countrymen,
            they found, like his, an audience among
            a people who flourished on the ruins of those
            to whom they were originally addressed. <hi rend="underline" hand="#h1">It
            has been said that Zeno had a presentiment
            of the stern simplicity of Rome, and with
            equal truth it might be said that Boethius
            had a presentiment of the romantic and
            truth-loving devotion of the Middle Ages.</hi></p>
            <p>But though Chaucer inherited the ethical

            features which distinguish it from the work

            She is neither more nor less than the embodiment

            central point of the whole system of chivalry,
            and her substitution for the philosophy or

            The "Margarite" seems to correspond
            to the chivalrous idea of the "Lady
            love" in its purest sense, when its reference
            to an individual was by no means indispensable,
            but when it signified rather the "love

            rather frigid comfort administered to him,
            greatly resembling that which Boethius receives
            at the hand of Philosophy. Such is

            with the treatise of Boethius, from which it
            is professedly imitated, its inferiority as a
            work of art is very apparent. The one may
            very aptly be compared to a bright sunny
            day in the end of October, when much of the
            richness of vegetation still lingers though its
            vitality be gone, whilst the other resembles
            an arid day in March, when through the
            biting east winds of our northern spring, we
            with difficulty distinguish the germs of life

            <p xml:id="p17b" next="#p17a">as in his philosophy, Chaucer was the expression
            of his time. Though it is well
            known that <hi rend="underline" hand="#h1">both by his interests and his
            sympathies he was all along united with the
            reforming party in the Church,</hi> we fear that
            we cannot claim for him the epithet of a reformer
            in the sense in which it unquestionably
            belongs to Wycliffe. From his early
            translation of the "Roman de la Rose," up
            to the crowning efforts of his genius in the
            Canterbury Tales, the corruptions of the
            clergy were no doubt the unceasing objects
            of his satire, and the baneful influence which
            their vices exercised on the civil as well as
            the religious society of the time called forth
            continually his pathetic, and, we doubt not,
            his sincere lamentations. The biographer
            of Wycliffe has well remarked that "few
            are the evils, either in Church or in the
            state of society, to which the censure of
            Wycliffe was applied, which may not be
            found as the subject of satire or complaint
            in the poems of Chaucer." Still we must
            repeat he was no "thorough-going" reformer.
            Perhaps he was not bold enough;
            perhaps, with Erasmus, whose conduct in
            this respect was open to the same reproach,
            <span rend="singleLine-left" hand="#h1" xml:id="s55" from="#s55" to="#s56"/>he would have said, "non omnes ad martyriam
            satis habent roboris; vereor autem, ne,
            si quid inciderit tumultus, Petrum sim imitaturus."
            We incline, however, to the
            opinion that the position which Chaucer
            held with reference to the Reformers was
            consistent with the honest sentiments of his
            heart, notwithstanding the suspicion of interestedness
            to which it is manifestly exposed
            from its coincidence with that of his great
            friend and patron John of Gaunt. He felt,
            as England and Europe felt at the time, that
            the hour for the <choice><sic>downfal</sic><corr>downfall</corr></choice> of the priesthood
            had not yet arrived, that they still had a part
            to play and functions to discharge in the history
            of the world, which in spite of their corruptions
            they would discharge, better or
            worse, and which could not with safety be
            <choice><orig>intrusted</orig><reg>entrusted</reg></choice> to any other body of men which
            then existed. <hi rend="underline" hand="#h1">They were still the custodiers
            of nearly all the learning of the age, and it
            was in their community alone that civilization
            as yet had found a secure and permanent
            <anchor xml:id="s56"/>resting place, for the class of nonclerical
            men of letters to which he himself
            belonged was far too insignificant to undertake
            the task of preserving even secular
            knowledge.</hi> Though the clergy were indolent,
            their efforts, when they did exert
            themselves, were so much more in accordance
            with his own views of what was
            worthy of rational <choice><orig>endeavour</orig><reg>endeavor</reg></choice> than those of
            the fighting and gasconading laymen of his
            day, that Chaucer, along with the scorn
            which he so unhesitatingly expressed for<cb/>
                <milestone unit="undeclared" rend="vertbar-full"/>
            individual members of the body, had probably
            anything but a hostile feeling towards
            them as a class. Above all, <hi rend="underline" hand="#h1">Chaucer was a
            cheerful, hopeful man; some one has said
            that he was the "gayest and most cheerful
            writer of our language,"</hi> and certain it is
            that the natural bent of his mind led him to
            view the sunny rather than the shady side
            of human affairs. He had nothing of the
            stern and uncompromising genius of a true
            reformer; <choice><orig>humour</orig><reg>humor</reg></choice> and sarcasm are the
            characteristics of his satire, and for the
            scorching indignation of Juvenal, or the still
            more lofty reproof of Tacitus, we should
            search in vain in his pages. His temper
            was too gentle for condemnation, too hopeful
            for despair. Such shameless charlatans
            as the "Pardoner" he no doubt exposes
            most unmercifully.
            <q who="Chaucer" type="written"><lg type="linegroup"><l>"His wallet lay before him in his lappe,</l>
            <l><hi rend="italic">Bret ful of pardon come from Rome, al hote</hi>."</l></lg></q>
            And again&#8212;
            <q who="Chaucer" type="written"><lg type="linegroup"><l>"He had a crois of laton full of stones,</l>
            <l>And in a glass he hadde pigges bones."</l></lg></q>
            But even here his love for the ludicrous
            continually breaks forth, and the description
            excites our laughter where it ought to
            awaken our indignation.
            <q who="Chaucer" type="written"><lg type="linegroup"><l>"A vois he hadde, as small as hath a gote,</l>

            <l>As smoth it was as it was newe shave."</l></lg></q></p>
            <p>This is not the manner in which Wycliffe
            spoke of such men as the Pardoner. Still
            we by no means admit that Chaucer was
            either a dishonest or a frivolous man. He 
            used against corruption such weapons as he
            possessed, and such as, viewing the matter
            through the medium of his own hopeful and
            sanguine temper, he conceived to be needful;
            for there is every reason to suppose
            that he did not regard the amendment of
            the existing ecclesiastical system as hopeless,
            and consequently that he scarcely approved
            in his heart of the extreme measures
            which Wycliffe recommended.</p>
            <p xml:id="p18a" next="#p18b">In judging of the conduct of persons in
            the situation in which Chaucer stood with
            reference to the Reformers, we are often
            guilty of injustice by taking it for granted
            that the question presented itself to them in
            the same pure and simple form in which it
            comes before us. We bring together the
            arguments which we imagine must have
            been used, which to our minds are so convincing,
            and which we know ultimately prevailed,
            and we wonder that a person of

            <p xml:id="p18b" prev="#p18a">could have resisted their force. But whilst
            we thus marshal the victorious arguments
            which now alone have possession of the
            field, we forget that the question must then
            have been complicated by a thousand considerations
            and sympathies, the strength of
            which we are now incapable of measuring.
            To England at the time, the proposed Reformation
            was indeed a vexed question, nor
            did the views of the Reformers possess, as
            is frequently supposed, the force which
            novelty gives to startling revelations. For
            more than a century before Chaucer's time,
            the opposition to the corruptions of the
            Church had been the cause of much bloodshed
            in the <choice><orig>neighbouring</orig><reg>neighboring</reg></choice> nations, and in his
            own land they had already been attacked
            by writers of every class. The satirical
            ballads which go under the name of Walter
            Mapes, and the so-called "political songs"
            of England, in Latin, Anglo-Norman, and
            English, were in everybody's mouth, the
            "Malverne hilles" had already been the
            scene of the "ploughman's vision," and we
            have mentioned Chaucer's own early translation
            of the "Roman de la Rose." All of
            these works, and others which could be
            mentioned, and many which are forgotten,
            derived their point from the state of feeling
            which then existed with reference to
            the clergy, including of course the Monastic
            orders. As a question simply, it cannot be
            doubted that the subject was very familiar
            to Chaucer's mind; and it is perhaps in its
            very familiarity <hi rend="italic">as a question</hi> that we are to
            look for the cause of its never having assumed
            a more definite form.</p>
            <p>In this respect the poet occupies unquestionably
            a much less lofty position than the
            heroic and devoted Rector of Lutterworth,
            but his conduct is still altogether consistent
            with the character which we have assigned
            him as the man of the present. The indecision
            under which he <choice><orig>laboured</orig><reg>labored</reg></choice> was the
            characteristic of the time; and two centuries
            more were required before words

            the dreams of Wycliffe obtained their

            something more than "a good preaching

            nothing of the grandeur of him who stood
            alone before the Oxford Convocation, like

            and hoped was his death-bed, and to exhort
            him to renounce his errors, greeted them
            after a fashion which still more forcibly reminds
            us of the sturdy German. The
            anecdote is so characteristic, that we shall
            give it in the words of his biographer.
            <span rend="bracket-right" hand="#h1" xml:id="s61" from="#s61" to="#s62"/>The Reformer, reduced to the last stage of

            and of Wycliffe with the Duke of Lancaster,
            renders it highly probable that they
            were personal friends; and if such was the
            case, it is pleasing to reflect that the gentle
            piety of the country rector was even more
            highly appreciated by the poet than the
            grander qualities of the intrepid Reformer,
            and if they met at all, there can be little

            or of the second, or scholastic period,
            impossible, we hold it to be clear, and it is
            equally clear that we have the phenomenon
            exhibiting itself shortly after an historical
            event which must have brought us in contact
            with a people who spoke a Romanized
            language, and such being the case, we confess,
            for our own part, that we are totally
            unable to separate the two facts, or to consider
            the one in any other light than as the
            cause of the other. The English language
            unfettered, and very probably (in its structure
            at all events) unaffected by the Norman,
            developed itself forth, but it did so in
            a proximity so close, and in the midst of a
            contact so continual, as to render it impossible
            that it should have borrowed nothing from
            so intimate a fellowship. There was no
            amalgamation, properly so called, there was
            not even, except to a very limited extent, (in
            words, for example, in <hi rend="italic">tion</hi>,) a direct adoption;
            the Saxon element asserted its privileges
            everywhere, and even on what it borrowed
            from the Norman it immediately
            stamped its characteristic forms. The manner
            in which this adaptation took place is
            well pointed out by Mr. Tyrwhitt, though
            he has failed to <choice><orig>recognise</orig><reg>recognize</reg></choice> its philological
            importance. "Accorder, souffrir, recevoir,
            descendre," he says, "were regularly
            changed into accorden, suffren, receiven,
            descenden." <hi rend="underline" hand="#h1">Everywhere we see the impress
            of the Saxon mint on the Norman ore.</hi></p>
            <p>But in proof of the direct influence of the
            Conquest upon the language to this limited
            extent, it is also important to remark that
            subsequent to the age of Chaucer, and what
            has been called the period of the middle
            English, when the process of absorption may
            be considered as completed, we have no further
            addition of foreign words, except such
            as can be directly traced to accidental
            sources. We had no more Conquests, and
            consequently our language underwent no
            further change, except that of the natural
            development of a Gothic tongue. That the
            original process was one of absorption and
            not of amalgamation, in the sense in which
            we have used the terms, is also clearly established
            by the fact that the further development
            has been entirely in the Gothic direction,
            whereas if the two elements of Saxon
            and Norman had been in anything like
            equal power, we might have looked for a development
            now in the one direction and now
            in the other.</p>

            the most absurd is that of asserting that
            Chaucer at the age of eighteen, when a student
            at Cambridge, having maturely considered
            the prospects of his own future celebrity,
            coolly set himself down to compose his
            "Court of Love" in English, as the language
            which was most likely in future to be
            that of his country, and in order to the proper
            accomplishment of his task, that he vigorously
            applied himself to purify and refine

            one might do in one generation towards its

            it to the Norman French, all that we have
            to say is, though it is highly probable that
            he knew that language sufficiently to have
            used it for purposes of poetical composition
            if he had chosen, the fact is by no means
            certain, and that he regarded it at all events

            Brought up from the first among his fellows,

            citizen, he wandered not,&#8212;nor wished to
            wander, in solitary places. His poetry is
            that of reality, and an Elysium which he
            sought not in the clouds, he found abundantly
            in human sympathies. We have
            spoken of his cheerfulness, and the best description
            which we can give of him, as he

            he is a cheerful, gregarious being, not
            ashamed to confess himself satisfied with
            the world in which God has placed him,
            and with those with whom he has seen fit to
            people it. There is no affectation of <hi rend="italic">t&#230;dium

            he fain would mend, he is still by no means
            disgusted with matters as they stand, and
            gladly and thankfully extracts the sweets of

            often reminds us of Rubens's pictures</hi>; but he
            <anchor xml:id="s92"/>is more tender, he has more feeling, and
            his gentler characters are touched with exquisite
            delicacy. The "Chapeau de Paille"
            will bear no comparison with the tender
            Prioresse that "was cleped Madame Englantine,"
            of whose womanly heart we have the
            following picture:&#8212;

            <p>The Prioresse's Tale is one of the happiest
            examples of the pathetic, in which
            Chaucer was so great a master, and there

            it, and others of the class to which it belongs,
            which we should scarcely expect in
            the writings of one usually so gay as Chaucer.
            There is so much gentle grief which
            pervades every part of it, that the reader is

            and if we compare it with the common version
            of the story which appears in the Percy
            Reliques, under the title of the "Jew's
            Daughter," we shall see to how great an
            extent it is indebted for its beauty to Chaucer's
            genius. If any one should doubt the
            versatility of Chaucer, and should be tempted
            to regard him in the light of a mere
            humorist, let him peruse the Prioresse's
            Tale, and consider her character along with
            those of Constance, the patient Grisilde, and
            others of the same class in the serious tales.
            In these touching delineations, the poet
            whom we had known, the man of mirth,
            vanishes from our sight, and in his place
            we have a character made up of the finest
            sympathies, and regulated by sincere and
            humble piety.</p>
            <p>Another characteristic of Chaucer as a
            poet, is his love for external nature. His
            poems seem everywhere strewed with flowers,
            and wherever we go we encounter the
            breezes of spring. The image of "Freshe
            May" is continually recurring, the very
            word has a charm for him, and in the Shipman's

            name. The description of Emilie in the
            garden, in the commencement of the
            Knight's Tale, though probably familiar to
            many of our readers, is so beautiful in itself,
            and so completely illustrates Chaucer's best
            style as a poet, that we shall insert it at
            length, slightly modernizing the spelling.

                will require us to glance, very hastily and

                he became publicly known as an historian.</p>
                <p xml:id="p26a" next="#p26b">His noble-hearted and simple-minded
                father, Carsten Niebuhr, by birth a German,
                had by his integrity, and the energy of an
                indomitable will, risen in the service of
                Denmark from the education of a peasant to
                be numbered among the most famous of
                Eastern <choice><orig>travellers</orig><reg>travelers</reg></choice>. In the year 1778, with
                his wife, who also was of German extraction,
                an only daughter, then four years old,
                and Barthold his only son, then in his third
                year, Carsten Niebuhr left Copenhagen,
                where he had held nominal rank as an officer
                of engineers, for Meldorf, in the South Ditmarschen,
                where he was appointed district
                secretary. His native place was in Friesland,
                from which Meldorf was not far distant,
                and with which he was now enabled to
                hold more frequent intercourse. For sixteen
                years the young Niebuhr continued an
                almost uninterrupted residence in Meldorf.
                This is the principal town of a dreary, treeless,
                flat district, abounding in marshes,
                which had an injurious effect both on his
                own constitution and that of his mother.
                Indeed, his German biographer<ref target="#fn15a">&#42;</ref> remarks,</p>

                brief notice are, 1. The work quoted above, (<hi rend="italic">Lebensnachrichten
                &#252;ber Barthold Georg Niebuhr</hi>,) being a
                History of his Life, in three volumes, containing a
                narrative interspersed at epochs with his letters. The
                materials were furnished principally by his intimate
                friends, Hensler, Brandis, Bauer, and the publisher
                Perthes. It was edited, we believe, by Madame
                Hensler, the daughter-in-law of his old friend Dr.
                Hensler of Kiel, sister of his first, and aunt of his
                second wife. It was published at Hamburgh, in
                1838. A translation of it, by George Valentine Fox,
                M. A., New College, Oxford, was announced in
                Tait's Magazine, November 1844, and specimens&#8212;
                which were tolerably accurate representations of the
                original&#8212;given in that and several subsequent numbers.
                What has become of this work? The whole
                of the original is deeply interesting, and to the British
                student would be highly instructive. 2. <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences

                            <p>Most of our poets, it appears, were born in the
                            Northern States. Massachusetts&#8212;prosaic, manufacturing
                            Massachusetts&#8212;has been the most prolific of
                            singers. No less than <hi rend="italic">forty-one</hi> of the American
                            poets were born in that State&#8212;among them Dana,
                            Woodworth, Sprague, Bryant, Emerson, Whittier,
                            Holmes, and Stoddard.</p>
                            <p>New York boasts thirty-two poets&#8212;Drake, Bethune,
                            Fay, Paulding, and a few others of some
                            celebrity&#8212;but not one of the first rank.</p>
                            <p>Connecticut shows a list of sixteen poets, among
                            whom are Halleck, Pierpoint, Percival, Brainard,
                            Prentice, and Burleigh.</p>
                            <p>In Maine were born Longfellow, Willis, Neal, Seba
                            Smith, Thatcher, and one or two others less known
                            to fame.</p>
                            <p>Saxe was born and lives in Vermont.</p>
                            <p>To Pennsylvania we owe T. B. Read, Conrad,
                                George P. Morris, Bayard Taylor, and G. H. Boker.</p>
                            <p>Poe was born in Maryland, and Simms in South
                            Carolina.</p>
                            <p>So far, no poets of any celebrity have been produced
                                in North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama,
                                Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Florida,
