                        Mythology as daughters of Jupiter and Mnemosyne.
                        They are believed to preside over poetry, music,
                        and all the liberal arts and sciences, and were generally
                        allowed to be nine in number. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Calliope</span> presided
                        over epic poetry and eloquence, and is represented
                        as holding a close rolled parchment, and
                        sometimes a trumpet. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Clio</span>, who was the goddess

                        tragedy, is represented as holding a tragic mask, or
                        bowl and dagger. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Erato</span> presided over lyric, tender
                        and amorous poetry. She is always represented
                        as crowned with roses and myrtles, holding a lyre
                        in her hand. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Terpsichore</span> was the goddess of dancing,
                        and is represented as crowned with laurel, and holding
                        a musical instrument. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Urania</span>, the muse of astronomy,
                        is represented as holding a globe and a

                        her left hand, and with her right raised, as if ready

            <p class="tei_p">'W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HEN</span> a man has once resolved upon a
                subject,—then, for a text,' says Sterne,
                'Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia
                and Pamphylia, is as good as any in the
                Bible.' Without pretending to be so easily
                satisfied as that very accommodating divine,
                we shall choose, for our present text, the
                London Catalogue; nor shall we be without
                grave precedents, both in his discourses and
                in those of much better theologians, if we
                should ultimately allow the text to play but
                an insignificant part in the sermon.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Our readers will readily surmise that it
                is not our intention to criticise this curious
                volume, or to trouble them with any specimens
                of its contents. But though we have
                little to say of it, it has a great deal to say
                to us; and, in truth, we apprehend there
                are few productions of the press more suggestive
                of instructive and profitable reflection.
                Still, as it only conveys wisdom in
                broken and stammering accents, we must
                endeavour, according to our ability, to give
                clearer utterance to some of the lessons it
                teaches.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">This closely printed book contains 542
                pages; and, after all, comprises a catalogue
                of but a small fraction of the literature of
                the time; in fact, only the titles of the new
                works, and new editions of old works, which
                have issued from the British press between
                the years 1814 and 1846; and not all of
                these. To this prodigious mass each day is
                added fresh accumulations; and it is impossible
                <span class="tei_cb"/>

                not to speculate a little on the probable
                consequences.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Some may perhaps, at first, be inclined to
                predict that mankind will in time be oppressed
                by the excess of their intellectual
                wealth; and that, operating like the gold of
                Villa Rica (to which it would seem that we
                might soon have to add that of California),
                the superabundance of the precious metal
                may lead to the impoverishment and ruin of
                the countries so equivocally blessed. It
                may be feared that a superficial and flimsy
                knowledge, gained by reading a very little
                on an infinity of subjects, without prolonged
                and systematic attention to any, will be the
                result; and such knowledge, it can hardly
                be disputed, will be in effect much the same
                as ignorance. Singular, if the very means
                by which we take security against a second
                invasion of barbarism, should, by its excess
                of activity, bring about a condition not very
                much better! 'A mill will not go,' such
                reasoners will say, 'if there be no water;
                but it will be as effectually stopped if
                there be too much.' In brief, it may seem
                to be one of those cases, if ever there was
                one, in which old Hesiod's paradoxical
                maxim applies—that 'the half is more than
                the whole;' or, for that matter, a much
                smaller fraction.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">And this dreaded result would certainly
                be realised if men were to attempt to make
                their studies at all commensurate with the
                increase of books around them. Compelled
                to read something of every thing, it is certain
                they would know nothing of any thing.
                And, in fact, we see this tendency more or
                less exemplified in the case of vast numbers,
                who, without definite purpose or selection

            <span class="tei_cb"/>the books he borrowed—an event which, we
            fear, does not always happen.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is probable, indeed, that a comparatively 
                small number of well selected books,—even 
                when our own,—would, generally, be likely 
                to form a sounder and more serviceable 
                knowledge than the unlimited range of a 
                large library. Most readers must have been 
                aware of the fastidious mood with which, in 
                moments of leisure, they have stood before a 
                goodly assortment of attractive writers, and 
                instead of making a substantial repast, as 
                they would have done with less to distract 
                their choice, have humored the vagaries of 
                a delicate appetite—toyed with this rich 
                dainty and that—and after all have felt like a 
                school-boy who has dined upon tarts—that 
                they have spoiled their digestion without 
                satisfying their hunger!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But without stopping any longer to examine 
                this paradox,—whether the multiplication 
                of books is to produce a diminution of 
                knowledge or not,—there are other consequences 
                of the prodigious activity of the 
                modern press far more certain to arise, and 
                which well deserve a little consideration.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">One of the most obvious of these consequences 
                will be the disappearance from the 
                world of that always rare animal, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">so-
                called</span> 'universal scholar.' Even of that ill-
                defined creature called 'a well-informed 
                man' and 'general student,' it will be perpetually 
                harder to find exemplars; while 
                assuredly the Huets, the Scaligers, the Leibnitzes, 
                must become as extinct as the ichthyosaurus 
                or the megatherium. It is true that, 
                in the strict sense of the word, such a creature 
                as 'the universal scholar' does not, and 
                never did exist. But there as certainly have 
                been men who have traversed a sufficiently 
                large segment of the entire circumference 
                of existing science and literature, to render 
                the name something more than a ridiculous 
                hyperbole. It is commonly indeed, and 
                truly said, to be impossible for the human 
                mind to prosecute researches with accuracy 
                in all, or even many different branches of 
                knowledge; that what is gained in surface 
                is lost in depth; that the principle of 
                the 'division of labor' strictly applies here 
                as in arts and manufactures, and that each 
                mind must restrict itself to a very few limited 
                subjects, if any are to be really mastered. 
                All this is most true. Yet it is equally 
                true that in the pursuit of knowledge the 
                principle of the 'division of labor' finds 
                limits to its application much sooner than in 
                handicrafts. The voracious 'helluo librorum' 
                is not more to be suspected of ill-
                digested and superficial knowledge, than he 
                whom the proverb tells us to avoid, (though

                        the first time, above five thousand; and in 1832,

                    knew everything when they had read these! 
                    Happy our fathers, who were not tormented 
                    with the sight of unnumbered creations of 
                    genius which we must sigh to think we can 
                    never make our own!'</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The final disposal of all this mass of literature 
                is with some easily managed. The 
                bad will perish, it is said, and the good remain. 
                The former statement is true 
                enough; the latter not so clear. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_resp_h2">'Bad 
                books,' says Menzel, 'have their season just

                How many thousand books have gone the 
                way of all paper, or are now mouldering in 
                our libraries? Many of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">our</span> books, however, 
                will not last even so long, for the paper itself 
                is as bad as its contents.' All this may be 
                true; but we cannot disguise from ourselves, 
                that not the bad writer alone is forgotten. 
                It is but too evident that immense treasures 
                of thought,—of beautiful poetry, vivacious 
                wit, ingenious argument,—which men would 
                not suffer to die if they could help it, must 
                perish too; the great spoiler here acts with 
                his accustomed partiality,—</p>

                <p class="tei_p">For the truth is, that the creations of the 
                    human mind transcend its capacity to collect 
                    and preserve them; and, like the seeds 
                    of life in the vegetable world, the intellectual 
                    powers of man are so prolific that 
                    they run to waste. Some readers, perhaps, 
                    as a bright company of splendid names 
                    rushes on their recollection, may be disposed 
                    to say 'avaunt' to these melancholy

                    it impossible that great writers, with whom 
                    their own generation has been so familiar, 
                    and who occupy such a space in its eye, 
                    can ever dwindle into insignificance. The

                    names of authors who once made as loud a 
                    noise in the world, of whom they never read 
                    a line. We should be too happy to believe 
                    the statement of Menzel correct: 'Of three 
                    good authors one at least will be remembered 
                    by posterity; while of a hundred bad 
                    ones, who are distinguished at present, not 
                    above one will hand down his evil example.' <a id="ref#note4" class="inlinenote" href="#note4">*</a> </p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is with no cynical, but with simply 
                mournful, feelings that we thus dwell on the 
                mortality of the productions even of genius. 
                We would be just, both to the living and the 
                dead, by admitting that thousands of the latter 
                who are forgotten, deserved to be remembered, 
                and that the former would 
                remember them if they could. Most pleasant 
                it would be, no doubt, in case human 
                life were prolonged in some proportion with 
                the augmented sum of human knowledge,—
                to lay out our studies on a corresponding 
                scale. Possessed of antediluvian longevity, 
                we might devote some twenty years or so 
                (a year or two more or less would be of no 
                consequence) to purely elementary studies 
                and discipline; the 'promising lad' of fifty 
                might commence his more serious school 
                studies, under judicious masters, in their
                full vigour and prime of three or four centuries; 
                and at the age of ninety or a hundred, 
                the young student, just entering upon 
                life (though as yet raw and inexperienced), 
                might be supposed to have laid a tolerably 
                solid foundation, whereon in the course of 
                his progress towards manhood through the 
                next two centuries, he might, by due diligence 
                and perseverance, build such a superstructure 
                as should justify some pretensions 
                to accurate and sound scholarship. But 
                alas! we forget that, even then, the old obstructions 
                to universal knowledge would 
                soon be reproduced in a new form. The 
                same insatiable curiosity, and the same 
                restless activity, operating through longer 
                periods, would rapidly extend the circle of 
                science and literature beyond the reach of 
                even such a student. The tremendous 
                authors who enjoyed a career of five centuries 
                of popularity, would be voluminous in 
                proportion; Jeremy Taylor and Baxter, 
                Voltaire and Walter Scott would appear 
                but pamphleteers in comparison. Their

                wherein the heroes and heroines would be 
                married, hanged, or drowned, after a courtship 
                and adventures of two or three centuries. 
                The biographies of the long-lived 
                worthies of such an age would be composed 
                in forty folios, or more; and the history of 
                nations projected on a scale which would 
                render De Thou's huge seven tomes a mere 
                sketch or abstract. The author who began 
                the history of Athens by a dissertation on 
                the geological formation of the Acropolis, 
                or the work of Leibnitz on the house of 
                Brunswick, in which he commences with 
                his 'Protogæa,' would be but a type of the 
                prodigious gyrations of such writers; so 
                that the hopeless student, 'toiling after them 
                in vain,' would be obliged to exclaim with 
                Voltaire's 'little man of Saturn,' who <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">only</span> 
                lived during five hundred revolutions (or 
                fifteen thousand of our years), that scarcely 
                had he begun to pick up a little knowledge, 
                when he was summoned to depart; and that 
                to live only for such a span, is, as one may 
                say, to die as soon as one is born.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But let us not be dismayed. The difference 
                in the position of the 'general scholar' 
                of earlier as compared with one of later 
                times, is not so vast as might at first be 
                imagined. Even the former, with all his 
                advantages, had far more books before him 
                than he could digest. We have but to look 
                at the index of their collected works, and to 
                mark the limited class of authors with 
                whom they were familiar, to be convinced 
                that each, after all, had travelled over but 
                a small portion of the entire ground. We 
                have stated that of the literature which 
                chiefly occupies each generation, the bulk, 
                even of its treasures, perishes; and as time 
                makes fresh accumulations, those of preceding 
                ages pass for the most part into quiet 
                oblivion. The process which has taken 
                effect on the past will be repeated on the 
                present age and on every subsequent one; 
                so that the period will assuredly come when 
                even the great writers of our days, who 
                seem to have such enduring claims upon 
                our gratitude and admiration, will be as 
                little remembered as others of equal genius 
                who have gone before them; when, if not 
                wholly forgotten or superseded, they will 
                exist only in fragments or specimens—these 
                fragments and specimens themselves shrinking 
                into narrower compass as time advances. 
                In this way time is perpetually 
                compiling a vast <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">index expurgatorius;</span> and 
                though the press more than repairs his 
                ravages on the mere <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">matter</span> of books, the 
                immense masses he heaps up insure the

                purpose of oblivion just as effectually. Not 
                that his contemporary waste has ceased, or 
                become very moderate. <span class="tei_add tei_add_rend_unmarked tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_add_resp_h2 tei_add_place_inline"><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight tei_span_rend_parentheses tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil">(</span></span><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight tei_span_rend_parentheses tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil">Probably scarcely

                fire, flood, or the crumbling of mere decay. 
                It is surely an impressive thought—this 
                silent unnoticed extinction of another product 
                of some once busy and aspiring mind!</span><span class="tei_add tei_add_rend_unmarked tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_add_resp_h2 tei_add_place_inline"><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight tei_span_rend_parentheses tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil">)</span></span></p>
            <p class="tei_p">Paradoxical as it may seem, the chief 
                cause of the virtual oblivion of books is no 
                longer their extinction, but the fond care 
                with which they are preserved, and their 
                immensely rapid multiplication. The press 
                is more than a match for the moth and the 
                worm, or the mouldering hand of time; yet 
                the great destroyer equally fulfils his commission, 
                by burying books under the pyramid 
                which is formed by their accumulation. 
                It is a striking example of the impotence 
                with which man struggles against the destiny 
                which awaits him and his works,—that the 
                very means he takes to insure immortality, 
                destroy it; that the very activity of the press
                —of the instrument by which he seemed to 
                have taken pledges against time and fortune
                —is that which will make him the spoil of 
                both. The books themselves may no longer 
                die; but their spirit does: and they become 
                like old men whose bodies have outlived their 
                minds,—a spectacle more piteous than death 
                itself. It is really curious to look into the 
                index of such learned writers as Jeremy 
                Taylor, Cudworth, or Leibnitz, and to see 
                the havoc which has been made on the 
                memory of the greater part of the writers 
                they cite, and who still exist, though no 
                longer to be cited; of men who were <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">their</span> 
                great contemporaries or immediate predecessors, 
                and who are quoted by them just as 
                Locke or Burke is quoted by us. Of scarcely 
                one in ten of these grave authorities has the 
                best informed student of our day read ten 
                pages. The very names of vast numbers 
                have all but perished; at all events have died 
                out of familiar remembrance. Let the student 
                who flatters himself that he is not ill informed, 
                glance over the index of even such a work 
                as Hallam's 'History of European Literature,'
                —designed only to record the more 
                memorable names,—and ask himself of how 
                many of the authors there mentioned he has 
                read so much as even five pages? It will 
                be enough to chastise all ordinary conceit of 
                extensive attainments, and, perhaps as effectually 
                as any thing, teach a man that truest 
                kind of knowledge—the knowledge of his 
                own ignorance.</p>

                is no help, however: humbling as it may

                man's mind as destined to decay, like his

                he knows must perish with it—it is the truth
                nevertheless, in the vast majority of instances.
                And in by far the greater number of
                the seeming instances to the contrary, authors
                still do not <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">live</span>; they are merely embalmed,
                and made mummies of. The works of the
                great mass of extant authors are deposited
                in libraries and museums, like the bodies of
                Egyptian kings in their pyramids—retaining
                only a grim semblance of life, amidst
                neglect, darkness, and decay.</p>

                splendid architectural monuments of ancient
                India, the names of whose founders have
                perished, justly remarks in his diary, 'Fame

            <p class="tei_p">Not the least instructive of the essays of 
                Lord Jeffrey, reprinted from this journal, is 
                that suggested by Campbell's specimens of 
                the British Poets. After remarking that 
                many authors of no trivial popularity in 
                their day, occupy the smallest possible 
                amount of space in such a collection, he 
                proceeds most strikingly, but sadly, to predict 
                the possible condition of famous contemporaries 
                a century hence. 'Of near 
                two hundred and fifty authors whose works 
                are cited in these volumes, by far the greater 
                part of whom were celebrated in their generation, 
                there are not thirty who now enjoy 
                any thing that can be called popularity—
                whose works are to be found in the hands 
                of ordinary readers—in the shops of ordinary
                booksellers—or in the press for republication. 
                About fifty more may be tolerably 
                familiar to men of taste or literature: the 
                rest slumber on the shelves of collectors, 
                and are partially known to a few antiquarians 
                and scholars.' . . . . 'The last ten 
                years have produced, we think, an annual 
                supply of about ten thousand lines of good 
                staple poetry—poetry from the very first 
                hands that we can boast of—that runs quickly 
                to three or four large editions—and is as likely 
                to be permanent as present success can 
                make it. Now, if this goes on for a hundred 
                years longer, what a task will await the 
                poetical readers of 1919! . . . . Then, if 
                the future editor have any thing like the indulgence 
                and veneration for antiquity of his 
                predecessors—then shall posterity hang 
                with rapture on the half of Campbell—and 
                the fourth of Byron—and the sixth of Scott
                —and the scattered tithes of Crabbe—and 
                the three per cents. of Southey,—while 
                some good-natured critic shall sit in our 
                mouldering chair, and more than half prefer 
                them to those by whom they have been

                superseded!' Thus does the fame which 
                looks most like immortality, resemble every 
                other form of that painted shadow; in most 
                instances it dwindles into a name; and that 
                name not always legible. 'Vanity of vanities, 
                saith the preacher; all is vanity!' <a id="ref#note5" class="inlinenote" href="#note5">*</a> </p>
                <p class="tei_p">In one point we can hardly concur with 
                    Lord Jeffrey. He seems to think that the 
                    lot of the poet, in relation to fame, is yet 
                    more infelicitous than that of the man of science. 
                    He says, 'The fame of a poet is 
                    popular or nothing. He does not address 
                    himself, like the man of science, to the 
                    learned or those who desire to learn, but to 
                    all mankind; and his purpose being to delight

                    all who can receive pleasure or join in 
                    applause.' Now we think it certain, that 
                    if the poet and the man of science are relatively 
                    of equal merit, the chances of being 
                    remembered are far more favourable to the 
                    former than to the latter. As we had occasion 
                    to remark some time back, in a case 
                    of no less a genius than Leibnitz: 'The 
                    condition of great philosophers is far less 
                    enviable than that of great poets. The former 
                    can never possess so large a circle of 
                    readers under any circumstances; but that 
                    number is still further abridged by the fact, 
                    that even <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_black-ink tei_hi_hand_h3">the truths the philosopher has 
                    taught or discovered form but stepping-
                    stones in the progress of science, and are 
                    afterwards digested, systematised, and 
                    better expounded in other works composed 
                    by smaller men. The creations of poetry, 
                    on the contrary, remain ever beautiful as 
                    long as the language in which they are embodied 
                    shall endure: even to translate is to 
                    injure them. Thus it is, that for one reader 
                    of Archimedes (even amongst those who 
                    know just what Archimedes achieved,) there

                of Newton, what must be naturally and universally
                the fate of inferior men? Of that
                treatise of Descartes, in which he lays the
                foundation of analytical geometry, how few
                of those who have pursued that science to
                heights and depths of which Descartes never
                dreamed, ever perused a syllable! The
                case of the cultivators of chemistry, and of
                many other modern sciences, is still more desperate.
                A few years obliterate all traces of
                their works; the fortune of which it is, to
                become antiquated while their authors yet
                survive—virtually obsolete, while the type
                is still fresh and the date recent. Their
                names will soon be known only in the page
                of the historian of science, who will duly
                record in a few brief lines the discoveries
                their authors made, and the still greater
                blunders they committed; will tell us that
                they were strenuous men in their day,
                and for their day did well; and that they
                are now gathered to their fathers!—Such is
                often the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">caput mortuum</span> of a life of experiments!

            <p class="tei_p">In that deluge of books with which the
                world is inundated, the lamentations, with
                which the bibliomaniac bemoans the waste
                of time and the barbarous ravages of bigotry
                and ignorance, appear at first sight somewhat
                fantastical. Yet it is not without reason
                that we mourn over many of those losses,
                especially in reference to history; and this,
                not merely as they have involved in obscurity
                some important truths, but for a reason more
                nearly related to our present subject, and
                which has seldom suggested itself. Paradoxical
                as it may seem, it may probably be
                said with truth, that the very multiplicity of
                books with which we are now perplexed, is
                in part owing to the loss of some; and that
                if we had a few volumes more, we
                should probably have had many less. The
                countless multitudes of speculations, conjectures,
                and criticisms on those ample fields
                of doubt, which the ravages of time have left
                open to interminable discussion, would then
                have been spared to us. An 'hiatus valde
                deflendus' too often leads to conjectures still
                more 'lamentable;' and a moderate 'lacuna'
                becomes the text of an immoderate disquisition.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">On the other hand it is doubtful whether,
                —except in the case of history,—the treasures
                of literature, of which time has
                deprived us, and the loss of which literary
                enthusiasts so bitterly regret, have been so
                inestimable. We are disposed to think
                with <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_black-ink tei_hi_hand_h3">Gibbon, in his remarks on the burning
                of the Alexandrian library, that by far the
                greater part of the masterpieces of antiquity
                have been secured to us;</span> and that though

                some few have assuredly been lost, there is
                no reason to believe that they have been
                numerous. The lost works, even of the
                greatest masters, were most probably inferior
                to those which have come down to us.
                Their best must have been those most admired,
                most frequently copied, most faithfully
                preserved; and therefore on all these
                accounts, the most likely to elude the hand
                of violence and the casualties of time. 'I
                sincerely regret,' says the historian, 'the
                more valuable libraries which have been
                involved in the ruin of the Roman empire:
                but when I seriously compute the lapse of
                ages, the waste of ignorance, and the calamities
                of war, our treasures rather than our
                losses are the object of my surprise. . . .
                We should gratefully remember, that the
                mischances of time and accident have
                spared the classic works to which the suffrage
                of antiquity has adjudged the first
                place of genius and glory; the teachers of
                ancient knowledge who are still extant, had
                perused and compared the writings of
                their predecessors; nor can it fairly be
                presumed that any important truth, any useful
                discovery in art or nature, has been
                snatched away from the curiosity of modern

                truth; not to mention that, if it were so, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_resp_h2">the highest
                creations of poetry—those of a Homer or a
                    Shakspeare—embody truth yet more comprehensive
               and universal than any consigned to the page
                of history.</span> Montaigne remarks in one of his
                essays, that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_resp_h2">the value of history does not consist in
                the bare facts it records, but in the instruction the
                facts are capable of conveying; and this is so true,
                that the parts of history which are positively fabulous
                are often more full of significance, and have
                really had more influence than the most accurate
                recital of the bare facts.</span> Plutarch has, we suspect,
                <span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight tei_span_rend_singleLine-left tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil">with all his credulity and love of fable,
                really exerted more power over the minds of men
                than any of the more authentic historians of antiquity.
                The graphic account which Livy has left
                of the discordant counsels given to the Samnites
                by Herennius Pontius respecting the disposal of
                the Romans taken at the pass of Caudium, has,
                perhaps, about as much historic truth in it as any
                other of the 'thousand and one' legends which his
                historic muse (rightly so called) has seized and
                adorned; but the whole is infinitely more instructive
                and more impressive than any narrative of the
                negotiations for a surrender of prisoners of war,
                with which tame history has supplied us. That
                the fox spoke to the crane what is attributed to
                him in the fable, is very doubtful; and that some
                'nobody' killed some other 'nobody' may be very
                certain; but the fable, in the one case, is full of
                meaning, and the fact of history may be wholly
                insignificant. In our own age, </span><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight tei_span_rend_singleLine-left tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil">honourably</span><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight tei_span_rend_singleLine-left tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil"> distinguished
                as one of severe historic research, and
                which has produced more than one historic work,
                and one very recently, which posterity will reckon
                among its treasures, it is well that historians, while
                accurately distinguishing truth from fable, should
                neither forget the beauties nor the uses of the latter;
                nor, on the other hand, overwhelm us with
                facts, which no one cares for, and which it does
                not matter whether they happened in this way or
                that, or not at all.</span> In the department of history
                there is no more frequent cause of that plethora of
                books under which the world is groaning. Walter
                Scott's remarks on his own Life of Napoleon are
                true in their principle, whatever we may think of
                the application of them:—'Superficial it must be,

                    by a silent process of oblivion, each generation
                    far more than makes up the loss;
                    and though suffering from a glut, the world
                    goes on adding to their number, as if in
                    fear of an intellectual famine. One might
                    imagine that in some departments of literature
                    there would necessarily come a pause:
                    for instance, considering there is already
                    more of first-rate poetry and fiction than
                    anybody can pretend to find time to read,
                    that none would be found to venture into
                    these fields, unless persuaded that he had
                    something to offer better than Homer,
                    Shakspeare, or Scott! Equally prolific is
                    the literature of memoirs and biography.
                    There is a little better reason for this; yet
                    the rage for it, it must be confessed, is often
                    carried to a ludicrous extent. No sooner
                    does any man of mark or likelihood die,
                    than in addition to his life, whole volumes
                    of his letters and journals are thrust upon
                    the world. <a id="ref#note7" class="inlinenote" href="#note7">*</a>  But of all this it would be
                    as unreasonable as ungrateful to complain.
                    Fugitive as the interest of such literature
                    must be, each generation naturally wishes
                    to know more of its contemporaries than a
                    future age will condescend to learn: And
                    from almost the worst of such works some
                    casual gleam of light may illumine the

                boundless learning, nothing more than the correction
                of minute dates and the true version of petty
                events, his powers would have been sadly wasted. </span></span>

            <p class="tei_p">While the past is receiving into its tranquil
                depths such huge masses of literature,
                by a contrary process it is perpetually yielding
                us, perhaps nearly bulk for bulk, materials
                which it had long concealed. While
                work after work of science and history is
                daily passing away, pushed aside beyond all
                chance of republication by superior works
                of a similar kind, containing the last discoveries
                and most accurate results, it is curious
                to see with what eagerness the literary
                antiquary, in all departments, is ransacking
                the past for every fragment of unprinted
                manuscript. Many of these, if they had
                ben published when they were written,
                would have been perfectly worthless. They
                derive their sole value from the rust of age,
                just as other things derive theirs from the
                gloss of novelty. It may with truth be said
                of them, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Periissent, ni periissent;</span> unless
                they have been buried they would never
                have lived. How many societies have been
                recently formed with the laudable object of
                giving to the world what no private enterprise
                would venture to put to press. It is
                true that, judging from many of the works
                thus published, one might be inclined to
                say that some of our literary treasure-finders
                were too strongly of Justice Shallow's
                opinion, that 'things that are mouldy lack
                use.' 'It was with difficulty,' says Geoffrey
                Crayon, after describing his little antiquarian
                parson's raptures over the old drinking
                song, 'It was with difficulty the squire
                was made to comprehend that though a
                jovial song of the present day was but a foolish
                sound in the ears of wisdom, and beneath
                the notice of a learned man, yet a trowl
                written by a toss-pot several hundred years
                since was a matter worthy of the gravest
                research, and enough to set whole colleges
                by the ears.'</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But neither do we complain of all this.
            As in the case of memoirs and biographies,

            coming into contact with highly creative
            minds, like that of Walter Scott, may contribute
            the rude elements of hte sublimest
            or most beautiful novelties of fiction. None
            can read his novels and despise the study of
            the most trivial details of local antiquities,
            when it is seen for what beautiful textures
            they may supply the threads. It is the privilege
            of genius such as his to extract their
            gold dust out of hte most worthless books,—
            books which to others would be to the last
            degree tedious and unattractive,—and the
            felicity with which he did this was one of his
            most striking characteristics. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_resp_h2">In hundreds

            story from some obscure authors, shall suddenly
            be invested with an intrinsic force or
            beauty, which the original would never have

            which in fact they derive, in nine instances
            out of ten, from the light of genius which
            he brought to play upon them. In those
            bright morning or evening tints even the
            barren heath or the rugged mass of grey
            stone looks picturesque; or such uses of
            antiquity remind us of the gate of the old
            Tolbooth, or fragments of the ruines of Melrose,
            incorporated with Abbotsford. The
            quality, above referred to, Mr. Lockhart has
            happily characterised. 'The lamp of his
            zeal burnt on brighter and brighter amidst
            the dust of parchments; his love and pride
            vivified whatever he hung over in these dim

            <span class="tei_cb"/><p class="tei_p">of their hopes, it is well for genius to recollect
            that the doom may be indefinitely delayed
            by due care on its own part; just as,
            though nothing can avert death, a wise and
            prudent regard to health may secure a late
            termination and a green old age. Or its
            case may be compared to that of men who
            labour under some incurable chronic malady;
            it must be fatal at last—but by a due
            regimen and self-control the patient may outlive
            many of more robust health, who are
            madly negligent of the boon. It is astonishing
            what signal genius will sometimes effect
            to give permanent popularity to books, even
            in those departments in which the progress
            of knowledge soon renders them very imperfect.
            They maintain their supremacy
            notwithstanding; and their successors prolong
            their influence by means of note and
            supplement. Such will probably be the
            case with Paley's works on Natural Theology
            and the Evidences of Christianity.
            'Hume's History of England,' promises to
            be a still stronger instance, in spite not
            only of its many deficiencies, but of its
            enormous errors.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is, indeed, a great triumph of genius
                when it is capable of so impressing itself
                upon its productions, so moulding and shaping
                them to beauty, as to make men unwilling
                to return the gold into the melting pot,
                and work it up afresh; when it is felt that
                from the less accurate work, we after all
                learn more, and receive more vivid impressions
                than from the more correct, but less
                effective productions of an inferior artist.
                To attain this species of longevity, genius
                must not be content with being a mere mason,
                but must aspire to be an architect; it must
                seek to give preciousness to the gold and silver
                by the beauty of the cup or vase into
                which they are moulded, and to make them
                as valuable for their form as for their matter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The French were formerly very sensitive
                to our want of artistic skill in our literary
                composition. Indeed, Laharpe presumed to
                assert that 'Tom Jones' was <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the only book</span>
                in the English language! But we may take
                comfort on comparing ourselves with the
                Germans. There is no country in Europe
                in which the mortality even of valuable
                works is so frequently the result of a
                neglect of this sort as Germany; none in
                which critics, historians, theologians, are so
                content to give to the world their crude and
                imperfect thoughts; marked indeed by a
                prodigality, but as often by an abuse of
                learning; by a command of ample materials,
                but employed without judgment,
                taste, or method. Their books in consequence
                soon give way to another fleeting<span class="tei_cb"/>

                generation, manufactured in the same way,
                and with as little hope of permanent popularity.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nor is there any country, though all are
            chargeable with the fault, to which Menzel's
            scornful remarks on <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_resp_h2">'books made out of
            books,'</span> so strongly apply. 'Germany,' says
            he, 'is thronged with multitudes who, in
            want of any fixed employment, immediately
            begin to write books; thus reaping, as soon
            as possible, the fruits of what they have
            learned at the universities, and inundating
            the world with an immense number of crude
            and boyish works.' It is necessary only to
            inspect many German volumes to see that
            they are just the produce of a—note book;
            that the task has begun and ended in the

            out into a bookseller's shop</span>—where at the
            best, it may serve as a collection of materials
            for an edifice which somebody else is to
            build. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_resp_h2">Profuse reading is often their only
            characteristic; and not always is there any

            with which each page after page in many such
            works is half filled, are often slavishly copied
            from other writers, and the parade of learning
            is as empty as it is superfluous. Niebuhr
            bitterly complains of this practice;
            and justly stigmatises it as <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_resp_h2">one of the dishonest
                tricks of literature.</span> He himself<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_black-ink tei_note_resp_h3 tei_note_place_right note"><span>☜ </span></span>
            tells us, and we doubt not with perfect
            truth, that he was in the habit of distinctly
            specifying all those citations which, though
            employed by him, had not occurred in the
            course of his own independent study of his
            authorities; and contends, that wherever a
            reference has been suggested by another,
            the secondary as well as the primary
            authority should be given, accompanied by
            the statement of obligation. We fear, with
            Dr. Arnold, that this remedy would not cure
            the evil; or rather that it would increase it.
            The pages of these merciless writers would
            be twice as dull from this double 'bestowment
            of their tediousness;' they would delight
            in troubling the reader with the whole
            history of each long literary chase; and
            consider a double, or, still better, a quadruple,
            array of references (though only a
            series of transcriptions), as a prouder proof
            of their erudition. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_resp_h2">What is really required
            is, that the writer should honestly endeavour
            to make his citations as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">few</span>, not as
            <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">many</span>, as possible;</span> and confine himself to
            the most decisive, brief, and accessible.
            As it is, the references are often such that
            scarcely three readers in ten could consult
            them, if they would—and scarcely one out of
            the three would if he could; while perhaps,
            nearly as often, the very point thus formidably
            supported, is a fact for which no

            authorities are the only things that require
            to be confirmed, and the proofs the only
            things that need verification. Doubtless,
            this parade of references is often employed
            for what Whately calls the '<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fallacy</span> of references;'
            —that is, in support of some
            questionable point, and in the hope 'that
            not one reader out of twenty will be at the
            pains' to verify their relevancy, or rather
            to detect their impertinence. But quite as
            often, they are used for mere ostentation.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Those authors, whose subjects require
            them to be voluminous, will do well, if they
            would be remembered as long as possible,
            not to omit a duty, which authors in general,
            but especially modern authors, are too apt
            to neglect—that of appending to their works
            a good index. For their deplorable deficiencies
            in this respect, Professor De Morgan,
            speaking of historians, assigns the
            curious reason, 'that they think to oblige
            their readers to go through with them from
            beginning to end, by making this the only
            way of coming at the contents of their
            volumes. They are much mistaken; and
            they might learn from their own mode of
            dealing with the writings of others, how
            their own will be used in turn.' <a id="ref#note9" class="inlinenote" href="#note9">*</a>  We think

            probably had much more to do with the
            matter, than the reasons thus humorously
            assigned; but the fact which he proceeds
            to mention is incontestably true. 'No
            writer' [of this class], says he, 'is so

            let the writer who attempts to attain fame
            by any such fantastic methods, recollect
            how ridiculous a reigning fashion looks a
            century afterwards; for not less ridiculous
            will then appear every thing that bears the
            mark of affectation and mannerism, however
            successful for a time. The Euphuism of
            Elizabeth's day is now viewed only with
            contemptuous wonder: and even Dr. Johnson,
            though he still retains a large measure
            of popularity, would have retained far more
            had it not been for his antitheses and his
            Latinisms.</span> Addison, though nearly a century
            earlier, is still more admired, and
            without any deductions.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It may be said, perhaps, that if in so vast
                a majority of cases the hope of immortality
                is a dream, it does not much matter how
                men write. Success, though ephemeral, is
                the great point.— To this we have, of course,
                nothing to say, except that we trust, many
                would rather not gain reputation at all,
                durable or brief, by a departure from simplicity
                and nature; and that, though immortality
                be out of the case, a gentle decay
                and serene old age have always been
                thought desirable things, rather than a
                sudden and violent dissolution. Immortality
                is not to be thought of—but <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">euthanasia</span> <span class="tei_add_rend_insertion_mark">^</span><span class="tei_add tei_add_rend_insertion tei_add_place_bottom">"euthanasia"

                whether critical or theological, pass away;
                but they themselves retain their hold on the
                human mind, become engrafted into the
                literature of every civilised nation, and
                continue to evoke a never ending series of
                volumes in their defence, illustration, or

                we think it may be affirmed, from

                one third of the works it contains are the
                consequence, more or less direct, of the two
                portions of literature to which we here

            <p class="tei_p">The old Greek and Roman Classics have

                    extracts, or happier still! embalmed in those
                    vast works which will consign to posterity the
                    history of great nations; with the whole
                    story of their political, social, and intellectual
                    development. How many authors, else
                    utterly forgotten, will leave minute relics of
                    themselves in the notes and citations of such
                    works as those of Gibbon and Macaulay. It
                    is but a plank from the wreck, to be sure;
                    but it is something.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Nor do the fond author's hopes end here.
                    We have compared the vast relics of decayed
                    and mouldering literature to the
                    animal and vegetable remains on which our
                    living world flourishes; in which it fastens
                    its roots, and over which it waves its
                    luxuriance. A fanciful mind might pursue
                    the analogy a little further, and discern
                    some resemblance between the mutations
                    and revolutions of literature and books, and
                    those incomparably greater, and yet, to us,
                    scarcely more interesting changes which
                    have swept over the surface of the material
                    world. Geologists tell us of the successive
                    submersion and elevation of vast tracts of
                    earth,—now rich in animal and vegetable
                    life,—then buried for unnumbered ages in
                    oblivion,—then again reappearing to the
                    light of day, and bearing dank and dripping
                    from the ocean bed, the memorials of their
                    past glories. It is much the same with
                    the treasures of buried literature. Long
                    whelmed beneath the inundations of barbarism,
                    or buried in the volcanic eruptions
                    of war and conquest, we see them, after
                    centuries of 'cold obstruction,' once more

                <p class="tei_p">Though this is the grandest of all such
                    restorations, let the author remember for his
                    comfort (if not too bashful), that a similar
                    process is perpetually going on, though on a
                    smaller scale. Discussions and controversies,
                    which had been hushed for ages, break out
                    again, like long silent volcanoes; men turn
                    with renewed energies to the opinions of
                    persons who had been forgotten apparently
                    for ever; and names which had not been
                    heard for centuries, once more fill men's
                    mouths and are trumpeted to the four winds.
                    A pleasantly oracular saying, or a half-
                    anticipation of some newly discovered truth,
                    is found in the voluminous writings of an
                    ancient author—and excites a passing glow
                    of veneration to his name and works. In
                    the indefatigable grubbings and gropings of
                    the literary antiquary again, scarcely any
                    authors need despair of an occasional remembrance;
                    of producing some curiosities
                    for those cabinets where the most precious
                    and most worthless of relics are preserved
                    with impartial veneration. It is hard to say
                    what his spade and mattock may not bring
                    up. What honour to furnish to the Cuviers
                    of critical science, though but in a fossil
                    bone or shell, a theme for their conjectures
                    and learned dissertations; and perhaps be
                    even constructed into a more magnificent
                    creature than nature ever made the original!

                    <span class="tei_cb"/>It is true that a malicious wit

                the dust, and that its resurrection is but for
                a second celebration of its obsequies. They

            founded in a juster estimate of his real
            claims on the gratitude and reverence of
            mankind, and that he is invited to wield the
            sceptre, not of a despot, but of a constitutional
            monarch.</span></p>
            <p class="tei_p">But our author sighs, and says with truth
            and naïveté, 'there are so few Aristotles!'
            We reply, with a perseverance in suggesting
            consolation worthy of Boethius or Mr. Shandy,
            that, supposing none of these sedatives
            sufficient to soothe wounded vanity, there
            are still others. And among them, assuredly
            not the least, are those least thought of; we
            mean, the pleasure of composition itself;
            perhaps, after all, the greatest of an author's
            rewards: just as in so many other cases,
            happiness is found, not in the object we professedly
            seek, but in the efforts to obtain it,
            and in the energetic employment of our
            faculties. If, indeed, the experience of
            Buffon were that of authors in general, none
            would deny this, and the passion for writing
            would become a universal madness. Speaking
            of the hours of composition, he says,
            'These are the most <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">luxurious</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">delightful</span>
            moments of life; which have often enticed
            me to pass fourteen hours a day at my desk,
            in a state of transport; this gratification,
            more than glory, is my reward.' <a id="ref#note10" class="inlinenote" href="#note10">*</a>  But we
            fear that there are not a few writers, and of
            no mean fame, who, while conceding that
            when their minds wrought freely and their
            faculties lay in sunshine, the moments of
            composition were among the happiest of their
            life, would also affirm that those in which
            they have had to struggle against the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">vis
            inertiæ</span> which prevented them from commencing
            their task, or had to contend with

            mist, and thought became clear and words
            obedient, were among the most painful.
            Well spoke one who has, we apprehend, experienced
            all the raptures and all the agonies
            of composition:—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We are inclined to place the pleasure of
            writing itself, among the chief incentives of
            authorship; and the proof is found in this,
            that so few ever stop when they have once
            begun,—not even for neglect or poverty.
            'There are millions of men,' says Byron,
            'who have never written a book, but few
            who have written <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">only one</span>.' And Walter
            Scott's testimony to the inveteracy of the
            <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cacoethes scribendi</span> is equally strong. Not
            even the ointment of sarcasm and satire can
            cure it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Perhaps even this will not be taken as
            sufficient compensation: why then let the
            author remember that in the only intelligible
            sense, he enjoys almost as extensive a fame
            as his betters. There is a little circle of
            which each man is the centre; and this
            narrow theatre is generally enough for the
            accommodating vanity of hte human heart.
            Indeed, it is of that microcosm in which each
            man dwells, that even the loftiest ambition is
            <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">really</span> thinking, when it whispers to itself
            some folly about distant regions and remote
            ages, whose unheard plaudits will never
            greet his ear, and which he utterly fails to
            realise. It is, after all, the applause of the
            familiar friends, among whom he daily lives,
            that he craves and loves. It may be doubted
            whether Musæus was ever so delighted
            with the thought of posthumous renown, as
            he was when his little boy, discovering from
            an upstairs window a fresh troop of visitors
            coming, as the child supposed, with the usual
            offering of congratulations on his father's
            sudden success, cried out, 'Here are more
            people coming to praise papa!'</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Should our friends and family form too
            small a sphere for the vaulting ambition of
            self-love, we must needs content ourselves
            with the questionable comfort suggested in
            the case of our literal death, not only by
            Cicero and his imitator Mr. Shandy, but by
            all other consolers, from the time of Job's
            comforters downwards;—that it is the 'common
            lot,' and that 'what is the doom of our
            betters is good enough for us.' Nor will
            vanity fail to whisper, 'Not the worthless
            alone are forgotten,—gold, silver, pearls,

                a degree each individual has done this!
                It is a topic easily improved upon, by the
                happy facility of human vanity; for all are
                ready enough to believe—and certainly authors
                as much as any—that they have not
                trifled life away; and to think of their doings
                much as Uncle Toby did of his mimic fortifications:
                'Heaven is my witness, brother
                Shandy, that the pleasure I have taken in
                these things, and the infinite delight in particular,
                which has attended my sieges in my
                bowling-green, has arose within me, and I
                hope in the Corporal too, from the consciousness
                we both had, that in carrying them on
                we were answering the great ends of our
                creation.'</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight tei_span_rend_bracket-left tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil">But, without a gibe, the destiny of the
            honest writer, even though but moderately
            successful, and much more if long and
            widely popular, is surely glorious and enviable.
            It may be true that he is to die,—for
            we do not count the record of a name when
            the works are no longer read as anything
            better than an epitaph, and even that may
            vanish; yet, to come into contact with other
            minds, even though for limited periods,—to
            move them by a silent influence—to cooperate
            in the construction of character—to
            mould their habits of thought—to promote
            the dominion of truth and virtue—to exercise
            a spell over those we have never seen
            and never can see,—in other climes,—at
            the extremity of the globe,—and when the
            hand that wrote is still for ever,—is surely a
            most wonderful and even awful prerogative.
            It comes nearer to the idea of the immediate
            influence of spirit on spirit than anything
            else which this world presents us. It</span>
            is of a purely moral nature; it is also silent
            as the dew—invisible as the wind! We
            can adequately conceive of such an influence
            only by imagining ourselves, under
            the privilege of the ring of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_resp_h2">Gyges</span>, to gaze,
            invisible, on the solitary reader as he pores
            over a favourite author, and watch in his
            countenance, as in a mirror, the reflection
            of the page which holds him captive; now
            knitting his brow over a difficult argument,
            and deriving at once discipline and knowledge
            by the effort,—now relaxing his
            smiles at wit and humour—now dwelling

            with a glistening eye on tenderness and
            pathos—and in either case the subject of
            emotions which not only constitute the mood
            of the moment, but in their measure cooperate
            to the formation of those <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">habits</span> which
            issue in character and conduct; now yielding
            up some fond illusion to the force of
            truth, and anon betrayed into another by
            the force of sophistry; now rebuked for
            some vice or folly, and binding himself with
            renewed vows to the service of virtue; and
            now sympathizing with the too faithful delineation
            of vicious passions and depraved
            pleasures, and strengthening by one more
            rivet the dominion of evil over the soul!
            Surely, to be able to wield such a power as
            this implies, in any degree and for limited
            periods, is a stupendous attribute; one
            which, if more deeply pondered, would
            frequently cause a writer to pause and
            tremble, as though his pen had been the rod
            of an enchanter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Happy those who have wielded it well,
            and who
            'Dying leave no line they wish to blot.'
            Happier, far happier such, in the prospect
            of speedy extinction, than those whose loftier
            genius promises immortality of fame, and
            whose abuse of it renders that immortality a
            curse. Melancholy indeed is the lot of all,
            whose high endowments have been worse
            than wasted; who have left to that world
            which they were born to bless, only a legacy
            of shame and sorrow; whose vices and
            follies, unlike those of other men, are not
            permitted to die with them, but continue active
            for evil after the men themselves are
            dust.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It becomes every one who aspires to be a
                writer to remember this. The ill which
                other mendo, for the most part dies with
                them. Not indeed that this is literally true,
                even of the obscurest of the species. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_resp_h2">We
                are all but links in a vast chain which
                stretches from the dawn of time to the consummation
                of all things, and unconsciously
                receive and transmit a subtle influence.</span>
                As we are, in great measure, what our forefathers
                made us, so our posterity will be
                what we make them; and it is a thought
                which may well make us both proud and
                afraid of our destiny.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But such truths, though universally applicable,
                are more worthy of being pondered

                thoughts continue to operate immediately on
                the spirit of their race. How sad, to one

            of departed spirits, to revisit this lower
            world and to trace the good or evil consequences
            of their actions, what more deplorable
            condition can be conceived than that of
            a great but misguided genius, taught, before
            he departed, the folly of his course, and condemned
            to witness its effects without the
            power of arresting them? How would he
            sigh for that day which shall cover his fame
            with a welcome cloud, and bury him in the
            once dreaded oblivion! How would he
            covet as the highest boon the loss of that
            immortality for which he toiled so much and
            so long! With what feelings would he see
            the productions of his wit and fancy, proscribed
            and loathed by every man whose
            love and veneration are worth possessing.
            With what anguish would he see the subtle
            poison he had distilled take hold of innocence;
            watch the first blushes of still ingenuous
            shame, see them fade away from the

            think that those whose faith he has destroyed,
            or whose morals he has corrupted, may find
            him out in the world of spirits, to tax him

                            the true doctrines of Socrates. But in a narrow and more proper signification,
                            it signifies the peculiar direction and method which Socrates gave to
                            philosophical inquiry. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Socratic</span> method of reasoning and instruction was
                            by interrogatories. Instead of laying down a proposition authoritatively, this
                            method led the antagonist or disciple to acknowledge it himself by dint of a
                            series of questions put to him. It was not hte object of Socrates to establish
                            any perfectly evolved system of doctrine, so much as to awaken by his discourses
                            a new and more comprehensive pursuit of science, which should direct
                            itself to all that is knowable. To him is ascribed two of the very first principles
                            of science, namely, the inductive method and the definition of ideas.</p>
