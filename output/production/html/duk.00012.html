                which, though it was apt at times to be divided, was sure to
                coalesce against a false court and a treacherous king. We can afford
                to dispute, while in the leisure of winter-quarters; but we are very
                careful, that, when we have once taken the field, to look for opponents
                nowhere out of the enemy's camp. That they should not be able to
                comprehend this, need not be a matter of surprise; for who can be
                surprised at any display of irrationality made by the managers of the
                whig party? The leading traits of that political organization, are, that
                its members forget all they should remember, and remember every
                thing they should forget. Nor time nor events have ever yet operated
                to teach them the erroneous points of their policy. It will be
                so until the end of time; and that it should be so; is perhaps a wise
                dispensation of Providence, to balance the weight which they derive
                from their wealth. Were they as wise as they are powerful, it would be
                a difficult matter to keep them from controlling every portion of the
                confederacy. But their wisdom is cunning, and their policy, deception.
                They have blundered on, for years, changing their name every
                lustrum, in the blind hope that thereby they could impose upon the
                people to a far greater extent than they have hitherto been successful
                in accomplishing—to the extent, namely, of obtaining possession of
                every branch of the national government. But once have they been enabled
                to achieve that object: and then their reign lasted but a few weeks
                —yet was it of a length quite sufficient to disgust the people, and to
                convince the better portion of their own number, of the incapacity of
                their party to carry on the government. To democratic quarrels alone,
                shall we be indebted for the repetition of the disgrace thus inflicted
                upon us. Were there no other cause to lead to union in our ranks, to
                diligent labor and personal sacrifices, this alone would be sufficient to
                render us ' one and indivisible.'
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">From present appearances, there is every reason for believing that
                victory will this year crown the labors of the liberal party in Ohio.
                Two years of Whig rule, have served to convince the people of its
                aristocratic tendencies, and of the unsafeness of the credit of the state
                in the hands of the men who control that party. So extravagant are
                their expenditures, and so unequal are the taxes laid to meet the effects
                of that extravagance, that there is no safety to the state, so long as its
                affairs are managed by them, any more than there is of certainty that
                the public burdens will be equally apportioned. The friends of economy,
                of state credit, and of equal taxation, have only to direct their
                blows against an administration already trembling from the effects of
                its own unjust policy, to place Ohio in the front rank of the liberal
                states of the West. Every inducement exists to those labors on our
                part, that are the surest precursors of victory. They will be improved,
                and neither the power of the aristocracy nor the disaffection of a 'corporal's
                guard,' can prevent that triumph which follows from the will and
                the work of a party resolved to accomplish a great end.</span>

            <p class="tei_p">The study of history is one of the most important pursuits which
                can engage the mind of man. To trace the progress of humanity —
                to observe the various steps taken by the human race in its toilsome
                march of more than fifty centuries, during which it has achieved so
                much of good, and perpetrated so much evil — must ever be a matter
                of profound interest to all who regard worldly things with a thoughtful
                disposition. Yet is the study a painful one. It is so, because, the
                more extensive our inquiries, the deeper our researches, the more
                thoroughly are we impressed with the limited nature of that which it
                is possible for us to know. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1">Our knowledge is to our ignorance, what
                the number of the living is to that of the dead.</span> We know but little,
                and that vaguely; while our ignorance is opaque respecting much
                which it highly concerns us to be familiar with. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1">Early history, in an
                    especial degree, defies our scrutiny. Clouds and darkness have settled
                    upon it. It is Isis, from whose face no man has lifted the veil</span>.
                We sometimes boast of the success which has attended the more recent
                inquiries into the primeval condition of the world; and, considering
                the difficulties which beset the paths that have been slightly trod,
                such boasting is quite pardonable, and should receive any thing but
                censure. But the works of the most profound inquirers into the men
                and things of old days, are, from the necessity of the case, but feeble
                guides in an unknown land —rayless lamps in a vast subterranean
                <span class="tei_span">world, to which the light of day can never penetrate. What know
                we, with any thing like certainty, of early Asia, the first home of man?
                what of mystic Egypt, so closely connected with our first religious instruction?</span><span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_note_place_left tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_note_resp_h1 note"><span><span class="tei_span">? Etruria</span> </span></span><span class="tei_span">
                what of comparatively recent Etruria, the source of much
                of Rome's distinctive character, and thereby impressing herself eternally
                upon the earth? Nothing, save a few facts, illustrative of the
                material life of their inhabitants, and a yet smaller number calculated
                to enable us to speculate, with some show of probability, upon their
                </span></span>intellectual character and spiritual views. In their case, as in that of
                the lost nations of our own continent, History indeed 'sinketh beneath
                her cloud.' They have fallen victims to Time, who 'sadly overcometh
                all things'; around them, Oblivion hath waved her wand of</span> 
                forgetfulness, thereby erasing the names of the founders of mighty
                empires, —' making puzzles of Titanian erections, and turning old
                glories into dreams.'
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">But there is another, and perhaps a greater obstacle, in the path of
                the historical student. As we leave what may be called the dark
                ages,—as the 'false dawn' disappears,—a new source of confusion
                arises. History then becomes the vehicle of man's passions and prejudices.
                It is made the instrument of partisans, the medium through
                which they seek to justify their several views to posterity, and to obtain,
                each for his own cause, a verdict from coming time. Writers,

                who should sit upon the bench, and from thence deliver weighty
                judgement, self-commended to all, descend into the arena, and, adopting
                the part of advocates, plead warmly and eloquently for either
                conservatism or its opposite. Nor is this the case with merely those
                writers who confine themselves to events which transpired in their
                own times, and in which they took part, facts sufficient to account for
                and to excuse a large amount of partisan sentiment; but it is equally
                conspicuous in the works of men who lived many centuries after the
                transactions of which they have written. The Englishman regards
                the contests of Rome, with pretty much the same feeling that animates
                him when contemplating those in which his own country has been engaged
                ; while the ' Liberation War' and that of ' Thirty Years' excite
                a scarcely greater interest in the mind of the German, than the particulars
                of the greatest contest of antiquity, the result of which, by
                striking down the supremacy of Athens, changed the character of civilization.
                Muller and Mitford are as thorough in their partisanship as
                Xenophon himself; and Livy was not a more devoted <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Pompeian</span> than
                Middleton. The great cause of ' Cavaliers <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">v.</span> Roundheads,' is yet in
                dispute, though the ink which it has consumed, might blacken all the
                blood which was shed in its earlier stages, from Edgehill to Worcester.
                Hume, with a pen as keen as the blade of Saladin, argues the
                cause of ' law and order,' in other words, the cause of a would-be despot,
                who wished for the existence of no law save his own lawless will,
                and whose sole idea of order was to be found in the fixed purpose of
                his soul to convert his free-born subjects into slaves as crouching as
                those who trembled at the shaking of the sceptre held by the palsied
                hand of the descendant of Philip II. Brodie enters the lists as the
                champion of the parliamentary party, and his blow is like that of Richard,
                which forced the sword through solid iron. From such men we
                have plenty of writing which has not the sin of dullness to answer for,
                as they are in earnest, and speak from the heart; but it must be obvious
                to all, that their works are not to be depended upon by those
                whose object is the acquisition of facts. We have compared such
                writers to advocates at the bar, but the comparison is hardly a fair one.
                Special pleaders may affect passion and sincerity, but as a general
                rule, they are passionless and hollow-hearted. Never blind to the
                weak points of the causes upon which they may be employed, they
                avoid even an allusion to them, if such a course is possible. The
                party historian, on the other hand, blinded by prejudice, can see no
                weakness in the cause he has espoused. His party and its heroes are
                all sovereigns, who can do no wrong—who cannot err, even if they
                would. What, to an impartial observer, are the weak points of his
                cause, are, in his opinion, its impregnable fortresses, its Valettes and
                Gibraltars. The motives and the acts of men are so distorted by
               <span class="tei_span">writers of this class, that the master-spirits of the world—men who
                have lived history—are almost justified in the profound contempt
                which they have entertained for the mass of historical works. ' </span><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1"><span class="tei_span">Give

                ordinary minds can draw just conclusions. It will be found, we believe,
                contrary to what at first would be thought to be the fact, that
                the events of those periods which have been most stirring and enlightened,
                are narrated with the most partiality. The reason must occur
                to every one. It is in those very periods that man's mind is most disturbed,
                that thought is most agitated, and conflicting opinions the most
                eager for the mastery. Radicalism, by the intensity of its attacks
                upon old institutions, becomes the parent of equally intense efforts
                for their preservation. Conservatism, by the tenacity with which it
                clings to even the vilest abuses, encourages the growth of the spirit
                of reform, which, gathering violence from unjust restraint, loses sight
                of the good in existing things, and aims at a general overturn. In
                ages like these, all sorts of views, on all sorts of subjects, are rife.
                Much is written, but of all that causes the press to groan, how small
                a portion is the work of impartial minds! Our own age, with all its
                faults, is the most enlightened the world has seen; —yet who looks
                for more than the shadow of truth, in the writings of the disciples
                and apologists of its frantic parties, its ridiculous sects, and its silly
                coteries of reformers or conservatives? What a precious work would
                be a history of the last sixteen years of our republic, written by a fiery
                democrat! We can imagine but one thing more utterly worthless,
                namely, the history of the same period by a violent whig. We by no
                means believe that democrats and whigs are incapable of writing
                truthfully about each other; but a zealous partisan is too apt to view his
                friends and their acts through a Claude Lorraine glass, which invests
                them with the rich hues of the blush rose; while the men of the opposite
                parties, and their deeds, are blackened in the same degree. It
                is an infirmity of our nature, acknowledged by most, and gloried in
                by some, that we cannot see the faults of those with whom we sympathize
                ; and to this must be attributed much of what is called the
                partiality of history.

                the Romans,' says Dr Arnold, ' and that which has so permanently influenced
                the condition of mankind, was their love of institutions and
                of order, their reverence for law, their habit of considering the individual
                as living only for that society of which he was a member. This
                character, the very opposite to that of the barbarian and the savage,
                belongs apparently to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1">that race to which the Greeks and Romans both
                belong, by whatever name, Pelasgian, Tyrrhenian, or Sikelian, we
                <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_note_place_left tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_note_resp_h1 note"><span>Law </span></span>choose to distinguish it</span>. It has indeed marked the Teutonic race,
                but in a less degree: the Kelts have been strangers to it, nor do we
                find it developed amongst the nations of Asia: but it strongly characterizes
                the Dorians in Greece, and the Romans; nor is it wanting
                among the Ionians, although in these last it was modified by that individual
                freedom which arose naturally from the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1">surpassing vigor of their
                intellect, the destined well-spring of wisdom to the whole world.</span> But
                in Rome, as at Lacedaemon, as there was much less activity of reason,
                so the tendency to vegetate and to organize was much more predominant.
                Accordingly we find traces of this character in the very earliest
                traditions of Roman story. Even in Romulus his institutions go hand
                in hand with his deeds in arms; and the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1">wrath of the gods darkened
                the last years of the warlike Tullus</span>, because he had neglected the
                rites and the ordinances established by Numa. Numa and Servius,
                whose memory was cherished most fondly, were known only as lawgivers
                ; Ancus, like Romulus, is the founder of institutions as well as
                the conqueror, and one particular branch of law is ascribed to him as
                its author, the ceremonial to be observed before going to war.
                The two Tarquinii are rerepresented as of foreign origin, and the
                character of their reigns is foreign also. They are great warriors and
                great kings; they extend the dominion of Rome; they enlarge the
                city and embellish it with great and magnificent works; but they add
                nothing to its institutions; and it was the crime of the last Tarquinius
                <span class="tei_span">to undo those good regulations which his predecessor had appointed.'

                Roman training. We cannot suppose that he would have written as
                he has, had he never been a captive and an exile, nor associated on
                intimate terms with the great Romans of his age. Livy's work is a
                master-piece, but can we call it history? It is rather a grand historical
                painting, eminently calculated to feed the vanity of the author's

                <p class="tei_p"> conduct of either foreign nations, or of the democratic party among
                the Romans themselves, is under consideration. Impartiality was
                not, it is probable, aimed at, so far as foreigners are concerned; and
                Livy was too complete an aristocrat, to have any regard for popular
                rights or popular leaders. Sallust has left two historical works, of consummate
                excellence, and on subjects which are intensely interesting
                to the student of Roman history, and which excite the liveliest regret
                that we have so little from his pen. But we must not permit ourselves
                <span class="tei_span">to be led away from our main subject, be the temptation ever
                so great. </span><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1"><span class="tei_span">The language of Rome, although her literature is not in

                and used only by the learned few, to whom alone access was granted
                to the works written in it</span></span><span class="tei_span">; and even now, it is far better known, as
                also is Roman literature, than that of the more refined and classical
                Hellas. Carried into every country subdued by her armies, the language</span></span>
                of Rome forms one of the principal elements of that of the
                enlightened nations of Europe, and of their American children; giving
                to them grace and elegance, which but for its contributions to them
                would be unknown, and securing from uncouthness, the expressions
                of the thoughts of great minds. If to the rugged and plain-speaking
                Saxon, we owe the strength that characterises our language, we are
                indebted to the Latin for no small share of whatever it has of the
                beautiful and the sublime.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Roman character is generally admired, and this admiration has
                <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_note_resp_h1 note"><span>Roman Character </span></span>increased the influence spoken of. But we think this admiration without
                much reason, and that it exists in consequence of the world being
                deluded as to the real nature of the Romans, by writers themselves
                entirely ignorant of the subject. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1">It is hardly possible to name a Roman,
                who would have passed, either for a gentleman, or a man of
                common honesty</span>. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1">Their most admired heroes, with but few exceptions,
                were hard, unscrupulous rogues, robbers on a large scale, without
                the slightest pretensions to either humanity or morality in its higher
                manifestations.</span> An American writer has applied to them the saying
                originally made use of when speaking of Carnot, and declares that they
                ' organized victory.' Had he said, that they organized robbery, and
                gave to it a sort of dignity, he would have been nearer the truth. The
                more accurate our acquaintance with the history of Rome, the less
                must be our admiration of its people. Nor should we allow ourselves
                to be deceived by the common cant, that the early republic was
                superior in moral worth to that of later times. Nothing can be more
                absurd, than the belief that the Romans were rendered brutal by their
                conquests—that their demoralization was the consequence of their intercourse
                with foreign nations, and the fit punishment of their disregard
                of the rights of those nations. In the days of the empire, the
                satirist and the rhetorician spoke of a people, whom they said had existed
                in the republican times, but who never had an existence out of
                their own diseased imaginations. So far were the Romans from having
                been injured by their commerce with the world, that they were</p>

                days of the republic, and of the imperial times, better than we do
                those of the first centuries; but only because the errors of an enlightened

                Even Niebuhr, who almost worshipped, not precisely the

                long upon a cherished topic, whom he mistook for them,—even
                he was forced to partially admit the immorality and the untameable
                ferocity of his favorites. ' Yet after all,' he says, when speaking of
                the 'good times of the republic,' 'if we bring those times vividly
                before our minds, something of horror will still mingle with our admiration:

                not only towards slaves and foreigners, but even towards fellow

                crimes may we not be justified in supposing them capable of perpetrating?
                Yet this people, through the ignorance of men who took it

                One thing is certain, that Rome was the result of a union of a variety of
                races—that she owed her existence, not to one race, but to several
                peoples; to Etruscans, to Sabines, and to Latins; and that her peculiar
                character resembles not that of either of those nations. The city was a
                confluence of human streams, and hence there is a significant truth
                at the bottom of the story which represents it as a place of refuge
                for the degraded of all neighboring countries; while the enmity of
                Rome to the human race, would seem to be foreshadowed in the lawlessness
                of her original legendary population—beings against whom
                every man's hand was raised, an hostility to be amply repaid in after
                centuries, when the Roman sword was to be drawn against all the nations
                of the earth. To those who feel curious in the early real or supposed
                fortunes of a people so remarkable as the earth's conquerors,
                Niebuhr's statements and speculations—statements always well supported,

                from the obloquy of more than twenty centuries, several of those
                illustrious men, who were sacrificed by the ruling order of the state,
                as aiming at usurpation, while in truth they were endeavoring to remove
                the yoke from the necks of the commonalty; and stripped others
                of unmerited fame. To these several points, we shall devote a few
                pages.
            </p>
                <p class="tei_p">I. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Gentes</span>—houses, or clans, as the word is rendered, though
                    not, as some hold, with sufficient accuracy, in either case—were
                common to many of the ancient nations. The original Roman people—
                the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">populus</span>—were composed of three hundred of these
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">gentes</span>, divided into three tribes, namely, the Ramnenses, the Titienses,
                and the Lucerenses. To the first, precedence was granted, or rather
                it was assumed, as the result of circumstances. They were the ' lofty
                Ramnes'—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Celsi Ramnes</span>. The Lucerenses were politically inferior,
                and do not appear to have been admitted to the full honors of the state,
                until a comparatively late period. Each of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">gentes</span> consisted of a
                union of several families; and though by some it was pretended that
                the members of a house were descended from a common ancestor, yet
                the bond of union was simply of a political character. Each gens had
                its designation, as the gens Furia, the gens Claudia, &amp;c., but the occurrence
                of the same name in different individuals, proves only a gentile
                connection. Thus, Cinna and Sylla were members of the same
                gens, but they were not what would now be called blood relations.
                They were members of the same house, but not of the same family.
                The family of which each was a member, belonged to one house, one
                of the most remarkable in Roman history—the great gens Cornelia,
                to which also belonged the Scipios, the Lentuli, &amp;c. Each of the three
                tribes, was divided into ten curies, each of the latter containing ten
                houses (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">gentes</span>). The members of each gens had peculiar privileges,
                and bore peculiar burdens. They had common religious rites, joined
                in the same sacrifices, were bound to assist the poor of their number,
                and to redeem such as were made prisoners in time of war. These
                three hundred houses formed the state, the body politic—they alone
                having political rights, and all the other inhabitants of the city and its
                dependencies, being either a community in a condition of political servitude,
                slaves, or the clients of the houses. They were, in short, politically
                speaking, the original <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Roman People</span>; and the government
                which existed in Rome, at the time referred to, before the commonalty
                had attained to power and the enjoyment of political rights, was an
                aristocracy, according to the original idea of that form of government. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_note_place_right tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_note_resp_h1 note"><span>aristocracy </span></span>
                ' A government conducted by privileged houses,' says Niebuhr, ' so
                long as they are still numerous, and actually the powerfullest, purest
                and noblest part of the community, is the original idea of an aristocracy: <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_note_place_right tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_note_resp_h1 note"><span>democracy </span></span>

                of the two words had fallen into oblivion; and it was then attempted
                to define them from some of their accidental properties.'

                early Romans, the only people of that name, until events led to what at first was probably a sort of federal union with the Titienses, or Tities. The first tribe was a Latin race, of the Opican stock. Their city was on the Palatine Hill, which, as Niebuhr remarks, ‘all legends agree was the original site of Rome.’ The dominion of this city extended to a distance only towards the sea, being bounded in the direction of Etruria by the Tiber, and by towns on adjacent hills, on other sides. The most important of these towns, was that situated on the Quirinal and Capitoline Hills, and which Niebuhr denominates Quirium, and its inhabitants, Quirites. The Quirites were a Sabine race. These two towns were hostile to each other. Wars occurred between them, and Niebuhr declares that Roma did not escape the common lot of subjection by the Sabines, the befel the Latin or Siculian towns, as of the well known legend of the seizure of the Sabine women, by Romulus and his banditti, is plausible, to say the least of it. ‘Let me not be charged,’ he says, ‘with offering a vapid interpretation of the poetical story, such as I should reject with disgust, if I interpret the rape of the Sabines and the war which broke out in consequence, as representing that at one time there was no right of intermarriage between the two cities, and how the one which had before been in subjection raised itself by arms to an equality of civil rights, and even to a preponderance. The preservation of Romulus and Remus, is a fable, such as may pass from the heroic poetry of one people into that of another, or may revive in several places, as it was told of Cyrus in the East, and of Habis in the West: but the rape of the Sabines relates to traditions of quite another kind.’ To whatever attributable, it is certain that the two cities became one state. They had one king—their senates were united in one body, and the people thus formed, were call indifferently Quirites or Romans. 
            </p>
                <p class="tei_p">Of the Lucerenses, or Luceres, the third tribe, it was impossible to speak with even that limited degree of certainty, that we can make use of when treating of the Ramnes and Tities. They were, according to good authority, Pelasgic Latins. Their city was on the Cælian Hill, and was subject to Roma at an early period. According to one account, this city was founded by Cæles Vibenna, a Tuscan leader of an armed band, who is said to have assisted Romulus. He is said to have been a Lucumo, the Lucumones of Etruria being in that country, what the patriciians were in Rome; and the name of the third tribe is sometimes derived from this title, which has been mistaken for a proper name. In that system which attributes the establishment of the Ramnes to Romulus, that of the Titienses to Numa, and that of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">plebs</span> to Ancus Marcius; the institution of the Luceres is placed to the account of Tullus Hostilius, the third of the traditionary kings. He is represented as having transferred the Alban houses to Rome, after the total destruction of their city. The meaning of this legend undoubtedly is, that by some monarch, whom it may be convenient to call Tullus Hostilius, the Luceres were raised from a state of mitigated political servitude, to a condition of comparative freedom—not to positive</p>

                <p class="tei_p">equality with the two elder tribes, but to a position greatly superior to that which they had previously occupied in the state. The whole subject, however, is involved in much obscurity; and the most that can be said, with any thing like certainty, is, that the Luceres were looked upon for a considerable length of time, as inferior to the original citizens—that they were slowly admitted to the honors of the state—that in the religious institutions of the state, a most important part of the roman polity, their inferiority to the first two tribes is most glaringly apparent—and that they were called the minor houses, the others being distinguished as the major houses. Among their number, however, were several of the most distinguished families of the republic. They were remarkable for the tenacity with which they opposed the demands of the plebeians to be admitted to the enjoyment of civil rights, and their unrelenting animosity to that order; and as the Julian gens was of their number, they produced the man, the great Julius Pharsalia. The Quinctii and Servilii, who were among the most ruthless of patricians, belonged to the third tribe. According to Niebuhr, the Tarquinii themselves were an Alban house.

The clients were the dependents of the patricians, and the parties were bound together by peculiar ties. ‘Those clients were neither gained their livelihood by trade nor had already acquired any property of their own, received grants from their patrons of building ground on their estates, together with two jugers of arable land: not as property, but as a precarious tenement, which the owner might resume if he felt himself injured. But all, however different in rank and consequence, were entitled to paternal protection from their patron; he was bound to relieve their distress, to appear for them in court, to expound the law to them, civil and pontifical. On the other hand, the clients were to be heartily dutiful and obedient to their patron, to promote his honor, to pay his mulcts and fines, to aid him jointly with the members of his house in bearing burthens for the commonwealth and defraying the charges of public offices, to contribute towards portioning his daughters, and to ransom him or any of his family who might fall into the hands of an enemy.’ (Niebuhr, vol. i, p.248) Our author says, that if a client died without heirs, his patron inherited. ‘There was a mutual bond between the patron </span><span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_note_place_right tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_note_resp_h1 note"><span><span class="tei_span">? origin of feudality</span> </span></span><span class="tei_span"> and the client, that neither should bring an accusation or become witness against the other, or give sentence in court against him, or in favor of his enemies: this looks like a mitigated form of the old law of compurgation.

                that the pontiff, as the vicegerent of heaven, to which the cry of the
                injured party was raised, devoted the head of the offender. To bring
                a charge before a civil tribunal was impossible: its interference would
                have perverted and destroyed the whole relation; which could not exist
                at all, or must admit of being abused. Still this abuse must have been
                threatened with fearful punishment: for to imagine that the patricians,
                who in their dealings with the plebeians neither respected equity nor
                compacts ratified by oaths, should have let obligations which were
                merely conscientious keep them such kind fathers towards their clients,
                as many are not even to the children of their body, would be a
                silly dream of a golden age, such as never existed.' (Vol. i, p. 249.)
                A body of dependents so strongly bound to the ruling power of the
                state,—what in the early ages was the state,—afforded bands of retainers,
                almost sufficiently powerful to inspire their patrons with the
                hope of being able to maintain their monopoly, against the assaults of
                the plebs—a point upon which we shall speak more particularly when
                we treat of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Secession</span> of the latter order. The commonalty, it will
                be seen, had good grounds for the hatred in which they held this body
                of men, who were so useful in keeping them in a subordinate political
                condition; and Niebuhr attributes the legend which says that Rome
                was the asylum in its first days of criminals from other places, to the
                hatred in which the plebs held the clients, some of whose number were
                refugees from towns that ' stood in a federal relation to Rome,' and
                whose inhabitants, were entitled to exchange their home for that
                city, ' perhaps under the obligation, at all events with the right, of attaching
                themselves to a patron.' Thus much on the general position
                of the early clients, who must not be confounded with those of a
                a much later age, when the constitution had not only undergone radical
                changes, but when its early character was completely known to
                but few even of the most learned of the Romans themselves. We
                may say of them, that their position, and the part which they took in
                state affairs, are involved in even more obscurity, than is the history of
                the third patrician tribe.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">We come now to the machinery of the government under the old
                constitution. As first in importance among the political institutions
                of those times, we must speak of the Senate. A body of this kind
                was common to all the ancient republics, whether aristocratical or democratical
                in their character. It was an assembly of the elders, of those
                upon whom age and experience were supposed to have conferred wisdom.
                When the Romans consisted of only one tribe, (the Ramnes,)
                the Senate was composed of one hundred members, which number
                was doubled at the time of the union of the first tribe with the
                Titienses. Another hundred was added when the Luceres were incorporated
                into the state. These three hundred senators were the representatives
                of the three hundred patrician houses; ' each gens sent
                its decurion, who was its alderman, and the president in its by-meetings,
                to represent it in the senate.' Such is Niebuhr's opinion, but it
                has been disputed, on the ground that the decurion was a military of-

                ficer, and not of the senatorian age. Those who disagree with him,
                hold that each gens appointed an old man to represent it in the senate.
                The division of the senate was into decuries, of which there were the
                same number as there were curiæ namely, thirty. One of the privileges
                of the first tribe, appears in a senatorial arrangement. At the
                time the senate had but one hundred members, and there were but
                ten decuries, ten senators, being the first from each cury, constituted
                the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">decern primi</span>; and this distinction was held by the first ten senators
                of the Ramnenses, long after their union with the other tribes; and
                the first of their number was the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">princeps senatus</span>, and who was also
                the praetor urbanus. The senators were chosen for life. The old opinion,
                that the kings raised individuals to the senate, at their own pleasure,
                is abandoned now by most scholars. Great changes subsequently
                took place in the constitution of the senate, and our observations must
                be understood as applying to the character of that body in the early
                times, and as having no reference to it as it existed in the pure historical
                ages. What has been established by the new school of writers,
                is, that the senators were the representatives of the houses, by whom
                they were elected, and not by the curies; that they were not of royal
                appointment. Of the influence of the body itself in the state, it is
                not necessary to speak, the very name of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Roman Senate</span>, conveying
                to the mind all that it is possible to conceive of the grand and
                the powerful—and we may add, of all that is heartless, cruel, and corrupt.
                What it was in the time with which we are well acquainted, it
                was in the first days of Rome, except that it acted on a stage more
                circumscribed.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">The king was chosen by the senate. According to Niebuhr, the
                only difference between the Roman monarch and a king in Greece
                during the heroical times, was, that the former was a magistrate elected
                for life. The king, he adds, ' had the absolute command of the
                army, and was the priest who offered sacrifices for the nation: when
                within the city he must have been the only person entitled to convoke
                the senate and the people, and to lay measures before them: but laws,
                and questions of war and peace, were determined upon by the citizens;
                though there could be no precise limits to the power of a successful
                and favorite prince. He had the right of punishing the disobedient
                with corporal penalties and fines: an appeal however lay from such
                sentence to the assembly of the citizens; a privilege which we cannot
                conceive to have been enjoyed by any but the patricians. Every
                ninth day, the king held his court: to his tribunal belonged the adjudication
                of property and persons, the protection of the legal possession;
                in a word, every thing that was subsequently included in the jurisdiction
                of the prætor, even the assigning a judge: if he chose however
                to determine causes in person, he might do so. His power over residents
                within the pale, and over all that did not belong to the houses of
                the citizens, had no bounds, any more than that of a dictator. Booty
                and land acquired in war were at his absolute disposal, so far as the
                claim of the citizens to the usufruct did not stand in his way. A part
                of the conquered territory fell to the share of the crown; which had

                the regal office. Though the senate made choice of the monarch, he
                had no power until their claim had been ratified by the curies. The
                power of these latter, however, was limited to either confirming or rejecting
                the person selected by the senate. </span><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1"><span class="tei_span">They could not originate

                authority.</span></span><span class="tei_span"> The origin of this practice, is thus accounted for by Niebuhr.
                ' In very ancient times, though the Quirites were to hold the</span></span>
                office in turn, the election rested with the Ramnes; after which however
                it was requisite that the person elected should be approved of by
                the other order: and this was done by the curies of the two tribes
                conferring the imperium. On the elevation of the third tribe, it was
                in like manner fair that its curies should be summoned to express their
                acceptance, when their election had been accepted by the other two.
                An institution of this sort will outlive the causes that produced it; one
                is however disposed to seek for reasons why it was maintained, when
                an election was carried on by all the curies conjointly. It may either
                have been that the person nominated had, like the Greek magistrates,
                to undergo a scrutiny and prove that there was nothing rendering him
                unable or unworthy to enter upon his office; and the delegated examiners
                were to make their report on the subject to the curies: or the
                entrusting so great a power was deemed by free men a measure so
                grave and hazardous, that they reserved themselves the power of deliberating
                upon it twice over. The latter was Cicero's view, even with
                regard to the annual and limited magistracies. As the curies however
                could not come to a vote on any matter which was not brought before
                them by a decree of the senate, there must have been such a decree
                in this case also: and if we suppose that the first choice was
                made originally by only part of the senate, there would be the same
                ground for this second decree as for taking the opinion of the curies.
                When these had ceased to exist except as a mere name, the senate
                still retained the power of refusing its assent: owing to this it was
                compelled to express its acceptance previously to the matter being
                proposed to the people; and the continuance of this formality misled
                Livy into supposing that the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">patres</span> who had to give their assent in the
                earliest ages, were the senate.' During an interregnum, ten senators
                were at the head of the state, and presided over its affairs.

                caused the fasces to be lowered, and otherwise paid homage, thus gaining
                his famous surname of Publicola. He was sole consul, in consequence

                Demonstrating by his conduct the groundlessness of their

                people, the members of the three original tribes. It was this assembly
                of the members of the ruling race, which gave so exquisite a decision
                in the dispute between the Ardeates and the Aricines, as to the right

                So long as we were ignorant of the truth, it was inexplicable, that

                proofs of ingratitude which writers with an aristocratic bias are so fond
                of adducing against them. The charge has been, that so long as
                Manlius was tried in sight of the Capitol, the scene of his great exploit,
                the people could not be induced to condemn him; but that,
                when the scene was changed, they did so readily enough. Now, all
                this is explained by the simple fact, that the assembly which acquitted
                him, held its meetings in one place, and the assembly that condemned
                him, held theirs in another. The comitia curiata met in the Comitium;
                the comitia centuriata, in the Campus Martius. It may be added, there
                is reason for doubting that he had any trial before the centuries, a point
                upon which we shall have more to say when we come to touch upon
                the history of some of the great men of the first two hundred years
                of the republic.

            <p class="tei_p">The comitia curiata could not originate laws, its powers being principally
                confined to the confirmation or the rejection of decrees of the
                senate. Without a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">senatus consultum</span>, it could not act. The most
                important of its duties, were, to confer the imperium, the nature of
                which we have already explained, when dwelling on the kingly office ;
                and the choice of priests. It was also held for a number of civil purposes,
                not necessary to detail. The votes were given by curiæ, and
                not by houses. Each cury had its curion, or presiding officer, who
                performed the religious rites by which its members were bound together;
                and its hall, called curia, common to all, and in which those
                belonging to it met, for both civil and ecclesiastical purposes. The
                thirty presiding officers constituted a priestly college, and had a chief,
                who was called curio maximus.

                and so singularly misapprehended. For ages, it was believed, and it is
                even now the belief of the larger portion of readers, that they were
                the democratic body in Rome, and contended against the patricians
                for rights, the enjoyment of which the latter withheld because they
                were a nobility, and the plebs were a mass of working people—the
                ' lower orders,' as persons of an exclusive turn, would stigmatize
                them; ' Jacobinical adventurers,' as a late learned man—whose strong
                conservative prejudices led him to look upon the masses with a hostile
                eye—would <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> call them, and who was a great admirer of the early
                Roman plebs, as distinguished from the body of the laboring people
                of those times, and from the plebeians of the closing years of the republic. To speak in brief, the great civil contest in Rome which
                continued so long, has been almost invariably regarded as a contest
                between a privileged nobility on the one hand, and the mass of the
                Roman people on the other—the former known as patricians, and the
                latter as plebeians. The plebeians were confounded with the clients,
                or supposed to have sprung from them, and were regarded as a sort of
                hereditary bondmen. This is now utterly given up, by all who have
                made themselves familiar with the more recent writers on Roman history,
                though as the works which are more easily accessible to the
                general reader were mostly written before that history was critically
                treated, it need not be a matter of surprise that this erroneous notion
                yet prevails. ' That the clients were total strangers to the plebeian
                commonalty, and did not coalesce with it until late, when the bond
                of servitude had been loosened, partly from the houses of their patrons
                dying off or sinking into decay, partly from the advance of the
                whole nation toward freedom,' are facts which Niebuhr has clearly
                proved. They are not matters of speculation, but historical truths.
                Of the clients, we have already said all that is necessary for the comprehension
                of their position, so far as it can be known, and if sufficient
                for nothing else, it shows that they were not plebeians.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">The plebs were of slow growth, though from conquests and other
                causes, there is no doubt that, at times, large additions were made to
                their number. The commonalty arose ' out of a medley of elements,

                as it was by incorporating such, that it supported and immensely
                enlarged itself.' It grew up alongside of the patrician houses, with
                whom it waged a long and bitter contest, which often threatened ruin
                to the nation. The founding of the great plebs, is attributed to the
                formation of a domain out of the towns won from the Latins. The
                name of Ancus Marcius, the fourth of the traditionary kings, is intimately
                connected with the origin of this order. ' In the accounts of
                the conquests made by the first kings, it is stated that many of the
                conquered places were converted into colonies, that the others were
                destroyed, and the inhabitants carried to Rome; where they, along
                with the citizens of the colonies, received the Roman franchise. With
                regard to the origin of the plebs of king Ancus, however, we are to
                suppose that after the destruction of Alba a portion of the Latins were
                ceded by a treaty adjusting the claims of Rome and Latium, and thus
                were placed in a like relation to Rome. The names of the acquired
                places given by the historian, rest on no sufficient authority; nor can it
                be any thing but an accident that they were all Latin towns: whatever
                people those new members of the state may have belonged to, their
                collective body formed a commonalty. Their franchise resembled
                that which in later times was citizenship without a vote; for a vote
                could not be given except in the curies: but their condition was worse
                than that of those who afterward stood on this footing: for they could
                not intermarry with the patricians, and all their relations with them
                were uniformly to their prejudice. Nevertheless, these new citizens,
                scantily as they were endowed with rights, were not made up then,
                any more than in later times, merely of the lower orders: the nobles
                of the conquered and the ceded towns were among them; as subsequently
                we find that the Mamilii, the Papii, the Cilnii, the Cæcinæ,
                were all plebeians.' (Niebuhr, vol. i, pp. 313, 314.) He also holds,
                ' that the plebeian commonalty arose out of the freemen thus incorporated
                with the state, is sufficiently proved by the tradition that Ancus
                assigned habitations on the Aventine to the Latins from towns which
                had been subject to Rome: for this hill was afterward the site of what
                was peculiarly the plebeian city. The statement indeed that they
                were conveyed thither is not historical: it is impossible that such an
                enormous population should have been amassed at Rome, so as to be
                prevented from cultivating its remote estates. Those who chose to
                settle there had the Aventine allotted them as a place for a suburb
                where they might live apart under their own laws: for the greater portion
                staid in their home: but their towns ceased to be corporations.
                The territory of a place that had been taken by storm, or had surrendered
                unconditionally, belonged by the Italian law of nations to the
                state: a part of it continued to be public property, and was turned to
                account by the patricians for themselves and their vassals: a part fell
                to the share of the crown: the rest was parcelled out and assigned by
                the kings to the old proprietors, in their new capacity of Romans. Often
                probably the confiscation did not extend beyond the public domain.'
                Arnold's description of the standing of the early plebs, is strikingly
                clear and comprehensive. Wherever states composed of a body of

                houses with their clients, he says, ' had been long established, there
                grew up amidst, or else beside them, created in most instances by conquest,
                a population of a very distinct kind. Strangers might come to
                live in the land, or more commonly the inhabitants of a neighboring
                district might be conquered, and united with their conquerors as a subject
                people. Now this population had no connection with the houses
                separately, but only with a state composed of those houses; this was
                wholly a political, not a domestic relation; it united personal and private
                liberty with political subjection. This inferior population possessed
                property, regulated their own municipal as well as domestic
                affairs, and as free men fought in the armies of what was now their
                common country. But, strictly, they were not its citizens; they could
                not intermarry with the houses, they could not belong to the state, for
                they belonged to no house, and therefore to no curia, and no tribe;
                consequently they had no share in the state's government, nor in the
                state's property. What the state conquered in war became the property
                of the state, and therefore they had no claim to it; with the
                state demesne, with whatever in short belonged to the state in its aggregate
                capacity, these as being its neighbors merely, and not its
                members, had no concern. Such an inferior population, free personally,
                but subject politically, not slaves, yet not citizens, was the original
                Plebs, the commons of Rome. The mass of the Roman commons
                were conquered Latins. These, besides receiving grants of a portion
                of their former lands, to be held by them as Roman citizens, had also
                the hill Aventinus assigned as a residence to those of them who removed
                to Rome. The Aventine was without the walls, although so
                near to them; thus the commons were, even in the nature of their
                abode, like the Pfalburger of the middle ages; men not admitted to
                live within the city, but enjoying its protection against foreign enemies.'
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">There has no greater mistake been made, respecting Roman history,
                than that involved in the opinion that the plebeians were a mass
                of poor men, mechanics, laborers, &amp;c. In the ancient world, ' even
                trades and commerce were in low repute, while agriculture was in the
                highest.' Now, the plebeians were a body of agriculturists, and
                looked down with quite as much scorn upon those who were engaged
                in pursuits of a mechanical nature, as they were themselves regarded
                by the members of the patrician gentes. Unlike the condition of
                things in the middle ages, artizans and tradesmen were despised in

                poorest agriculturist was of more consequence than the most wealthy
                mechanic.</span> Whatever the political inferiority of the plebs, they were,
                at least some of their number, of quite as lofty a lineage as the members
                of the houses, seeing that they contained many of the haughtiest
                nobles of the conquered towns. There was not in Rome a more
                proud and exclusive race than the Metelli, one of whose members
                treated Caius Marius so contemptuously, in the Jugurthine War, when
                he asked liberty to go to Rome, to stand for the consulship; a family
                as thoroughly imbued with the oligarchal spirit, as the imperious Claudian
                race itself: yet were the Metelli of the Cascilian gens, who were

                plebeians. But, though plebeians at Rome, the Cæcilii were patricians
                of Præmeste. Many of the early leaders of the plebs, as, for example,
                the Licinii and the Icilii, are said by the historian to have been
                no way inferior, even in birth, to the Quinctii and the Postumii, who
                were among the proudest and most vindictive of the patricians. It
                should be borne in mind, that there were plebeian gentes, which
                <span class="tei_span">originated in the towns the plebs were taken from, before they were

            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">A class of people like the plebeians, at once so numerous and so
                wealthy, containing many members of the highest birth, and embracing
                full as much of the intelligence of their time as the order that arrogated
                superiority to itself; would not long remain quiet, or be kept in
                subjection. We are not then to be surprised, that attempts to throw
                off the political yoke were made at an early day; nor should it appear
                strange to us, that the kings, impressed, as they must have been, with
                a full knowledge of the value of the plebeians, and not so blinded as
                were the majority of the other patricians to the importance of conciliating
                so powerful a class, were disposed to favor their claims—to the
                extent, at least, of elevating the more wealthy of their number to the
                patriciate. Niebuhr suggests, leaving the suggestion to rest on its own
                merits,' that, as in a much later age, M. Manlius was looked up to by
                the collective plebeian order as its declared patron, so at the first beginning
                of the commonalty the kings were its patrons.' He subsequently
                says,—' whatever may have been the form of the connexion
                between the commonalty and the kings, they protected it against the
                oligarchy: undoubtedly they could not fail to perceive that the plebeians
                in a continually increasing proportion formed the most important
                part of their military force; that on them all the hopes of the future
                rested; and that the only way for Rome to become great and to continue
                so, was for its laws to sanction and promote the growth of a great
                Roman people out of every people of Italy.' The first Tarquin is
                represented as having conceived the idea of elevating the plebeians to
                an equality with the patricians—of making them real citizens. His
                intention appears to have been, to create three new tribes, to stand
                alongside the original tribes. The project met with great opposition,
                and the hostility which it experienced from the augur Attus Navius, is
                well known, from its connection with a familiar story. The conservatism
                of the priesthood was never more strongly manifested, than on this
                occasion. It was, to a great extent, successful. The king, instead of
                creating three additional tribes, was compelled to content himself with
                calling up a number of the wealthiest plebeian families to the full
                privileges of citizenship. They were regarded, in effect, as inferior
                to those with whom they were placed upon a footing of political equality,
                by the opinion of the members of the elder houses. By this
                proceeding, a number of the most influential of the plebeians were
                separated from their order, and their sympathies enlisted in behalf of

                their new associates. For the mass of the plebeians, nothing advantageous
                was effected. They were, in truth, made weaker, both relatively
                and positively, by this display of regal favor; as a portion of
                their own number was taken from them, and added to their enemy,
                to whom they carried whatever of influence they possessed, so that
                they were enabled to present a yet broader front and deeper body, in
                opposition to the claims of the great body to be admitted to a full participation
                in the powers and rights resulting from citizenship. Tarquinius
                had previously caused the Luceres to be placed on an equality
                with the other tribes.

                Before his time, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1">the plebs ' was only an aggregate of unconnected

                them into thirty tribes, a number corresponding to the thirty curies of
                the houses. From this, the question has been asked, 'whether their
                name may not originally have been a different one, and whether ten
                of them were not requisite to make up a plebeian tribe; so that at
                first there would be three such, which subsequently sank to two?
                This conjecture is favored by our finding that the commonalty at the
                Crustumine secession had two tribunes to direct it; and that afterward,
                when the consular power was transferred to military tribunes
                chosen out of the two orders, their regular number seems properly to
                have been six, three for the patricians according to their tribes, and
                three in like manner for the plebeians. But, in this latter case, the
                intention may only have been, that, the number of the patricians being
                given, they should have an equal number of plebeian colleagues:
                and in the former, since twenty are too many to guide a people in a
                state of insurrection, as well as for taking prudent counsel, each decury
                of the tribunes may have appointed a delegate: indeed, why
                should not they, like the decuries of the senators, have had each a
                leader, who was to come forward on such occasions? In fact there is
                an express statement that the plebs at the said secession had twenty
                tribunes divided into two decuries, who had to appoint two chiefs.
                The votes of the curies being those which were told in the assembly,
                the tribes of Romulus had sunk into insignificance; nor do we meet
                among the Latins with any trace of a division standing higher in the
                scale than that into thirty towns.' If we suppose this hypothesis to be
                well founded, it will appear that the plebeian tribes of Servius had
                the same organization that the patricians had. The reduction from
                thirty tribes to twenty, is accounted for by the bad success of the Romans
                in the war with Porsenna, the result of which contest has been
                utterly misrepresented by Roman writers. They were, it is known,
                forced to cede to that monarch, that portion of their territory which

                was situated on the Etruscan side of the Tiber; and the story that he
                restored it to them, ' by an act of romantic generosity, 'has proved to
                be entirely untrue. A conquered people, in those days, were compelled
                to cede a third of their territory to the victor; and as ten of the
                plebeian tribes disappear, it is as good as demonstrated, that they,
                with the territory they occupied, passed under the dominion of Porseima.

                after the true Roman fashion, which never hesitated at a falsehood,
                no matter how egregious, likely to minister to their ambition, their
                vanity, or their avarice.</span> The political effect of this cession of territory,
                was most prejudicial to the plebeians, as, by diminishing the
                weight of their power, it rendered them less able to contend with their
                oppressors, and delayed their emancipation for a great number of
                years; beside which, it threatened ruin to the state on more than one
                occasion, by the encouragement it gave to the patricians to hold out
                against those who were contending for an equal standing in the
                republic with themselves.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">The number of city tribes among the plebeians, was four; that
                of country tribes, twenty-six. They consisted of plebeians only,
                neither the patricians nor their clients being contained in them, at
                least not until a much later period than that of which we are speaking.
                The patricians had no concern with these tribes, which had each
                its tribune, as also its festivals, &amp;c. These tribunes were supreme in
                the meetings of the plebeians, which could not be convoked by a patrician
                magistrate. The patricians and their retainers were compelled
                to withdraw from the forum, when the plebeians met. Assignments
                of lands were made to them, by Servius, by which they were established
                as a body of free hereditary proprietors. Earlier assignments
                of land had been made under former kings; but that was before the
                plebs had assumed the form of an estate. The difference between
                the patricians and the plebeians, in respect to the public lands, was
                this—that the former had the right to enjoy the profits of those lands
                by what was called <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">possession</span>, which word must not be understood,
                however, as it is now used, but simply as a privilege of enjoying their
                use during the pleasure of the state; while the plebeians received
                assignments of lands in perpetuity. ' From this time forward,' says
                Niebuhr, ' the Roman nation consisted of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1">two estates, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">populus</span>, or<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_note_place_right tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_note_resp_h1 note"><span> two estates the populus or burghers, and the plebs, or commonality </span></span>
                body of burghers, and the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">plebs</span>, or commonalty:</span> both, according to
                the views of the legislator, equally free, but differing in degree of
                honor: the patricians, as elder brothers, and moreover as each of them
                was the member of a far less numerous body, had the advantage of
                the plebeians, as the greater houses had of the lesser. I do not aim
                at prying into the mysteries of the ancient theologies; thus much,
                however, is evident: that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1">the Romans conceived every part of nature
                and every vital and spiritual power to be divided into two sexes and
                two powers; they had <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">tellus</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">tellumo</span>, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">anima</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">animus</span>; and in</span>
                like manner they probably also looked upon the nation as consisting
                of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">populus</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">plebes</span>: <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1">hence the names are masculine and feminine.</span>

                ries belongs to later; for the whole nation to yet more recent times: <span class="tei_span">along with the second meaning the original one long continued to prevail. It is related under the year 341, that the plebs, with the concurrence of the </span><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><span class="tei_span">populus</span></span><span class="tei_span">, committed the charge of investigating the murder of Postumius to the consuls: in this place no interpretation can attach that meaning to the word into which it has been attempted, though very mistakenly, to strain it in the saying Appius Claudius, </span><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><span class="tei_span">that the tribunes were magistrates of the plebs, not of the populus;</span></span><span class="tei_span"> where it is contended that </span><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><span class="tei_span">populus</span></span><span class="tei_span"> means the people in the centuries.’ It is subsequently remarked, that the distinction between the two orders is to be seen even in their games, which were two-fold, the Roman and the plebian. The former were held in the Circus Maximus; the Circus Flaminius was appropriated to those of the </span><span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_note_place_left tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_note_resp_h1 note"><span><span class="tei_span">The plebeians were as </span><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1"><span class="tei_span">one</span></span><span class="tei_span"> of </span><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1"><span class="tei_span">two parties</span></span> </span></span><span class="tei_span">commonalty. The origin of the use of the word Quirites for plebeians, in the formularies of prayer, is to be found in the fact that the plebeians now stood in relation to the patricians, precisely as the second tribe, the Quirites, once stood to the first tribe. The formulary was at hand, and it was adopted. The practice of addressing the assembly in the Forum as Quirites, arose from this custom.
            </span></p> <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_span">Such were the plebeians, and such was their standing in the state.</span></span> To complete the formation of that state, to fuse the different materials into one mass, was a work, the necessity of which must have occurred to every wise public man in the kingdom. The two orders stood in a position of absolute hostility to each other — the patricians resolved not to give way, and the plebeians equally resolute in their determination to make their way to a footing of perfect equality with the members of the houses. The plebeians, by their formation into tribes, had greatly increased their means of warfare. That measure was wise or imprudent, on the part of the monarch who perfected it, according as were his ultimate intentions. If he intended it for what in these days would be called ‘a final measure,’ the act was the reverse of wise; for, by giving an organization to the encroaching order, it enabled that order to contend with regularity and effect, thus placing them almost on a level with their oppressors, in one very important respect. But, if, as there is reason to believe, the monarch merely intended it as the first in a series of measures, having for their end the redemption of a great and warlike class from a condition of political slavery, his sagacity cannot be too highly praised. One thing is certain, and that is, that a great change in the Roman constitution soon followed the agglomeration of the various materials of which the plebeians were composed. The existence of two such orders in the state as the patricians and the plebeians, in the manner that for a time prevailed, was clearly incompatible with either internal peace or the safety of the country against the attacks of foreign enemies. A broad and sweeping change was inevitable, if the nation desired longer continuance. That change, fortunately for the Romans, was effected, and ‘the centuries were instituted to mediate between the bodies, and to unite them.’ The consideration of that great movement, brings us to the third division of our subject.</p>

                down into the Tiber exactly west of the Palatine hill.' This, like the
                embanking of the Tiber, with which work it is supposed to have been
                connected,—each forming a part of one great plan,—was accomplished
                by the elder Tarquinius, and was undertaken for the purpose
                of draining the wet and swampy places which existed in the midst of
                the city. This great sewer was vaulted, and was on so large a scale,
                that when Vipsanius Agrippa cleaned it, in the reign of Augustus,
                he passed through it in a boat. Carts could be driven into it; and
                Nero, among the rest of his imperial eccentricities, is said to have
                been in the habit of throwing into it, the victims of his innocent
                relaxations from the cares of state. The material employed in constructing</span></span>
                the Cloaca, was of a very different character from that made
                use of in the days of the republic—being the stone of Rome itself,
                a volcanic mass, which afterwards went wholly out of use. This is a
                decisive proof of the antiquity of the work. The lands reclaimed by
                the great drainage thus carried into effect, were used, one portion for
                a market and for the meetings of the people, and another for a racecourse. 'Such a work as the Cloaca,' says Arnold, ' proves the greatness
                of the power which effected it, as well as the character of its
                government. It was wrought by taskwork, like the great works of
                Egypt; and stories were long current of the misery and degradation
                which it brought upon the people during its progress. But this taskwork
                for these vast objects, shows a strong and despotic government,
                which had at its command the whole resources of the people; and

                such a government could hardly have existed unless it had been based
                upon some considerable extent of dominion.' The resemblance between
                the Roman monarchy and that of Solomon, has struck more
                than one historical inquirer, as well from the grandeur of the works
                accomplished by each, as from their common fate, produced by similar
                causes in both nations. ' Setting aside the tyranny ascribed to
                Tarquinius, and remembering that it was his policy to deprive the
                commons of their lately acquired citizenship, and to treat them like
                subjects rather than members of the state, the picture given of the
                wealth and greatness of Judæa under Solomon, may convey some idea
                of the state of Rome under its later kings. Powerful amongst surrounding
                nations, exposed to no hostile invasions, with a flourishing
                agriculture, and an active commerce, the country was great and prosperous;
                and the king was enabled to execute public works of the
                highest magnificence, and to invest himself with a splendor unknown
                in the earlier times of the monarchy. The last Tarquinius was guilty
                of individual acts of oppression, we may be sure, towards the patricians
                no less than the plebeians; but it was these last whom he labored
                on system to depress and degrade, and whom he employed, as Solomon
                did the Canaanites, in all the servile and laborious part of his
                undertakings. Still the citizens or patricians themselves found that
                the splendor of his government had its burdens for them also; as the
                great majority of the Israelites, amid all the peace and prosperity of
                Solomon's reign, and although exempted from all servile labor, and
                serving only in honorable offices, yet complained that they endured a
                grievous yoke, and took the first opportunity to relieve themselves
                from it by banishing the house of Solomon from among them for ever.'
                The elder Tarquin is said to have instituted games, for the purpose of
                <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_note_place_left tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_note_resp_h1 note"><span><span class="tei_span">Roman games</span> </span></span><span class="tei_span">recreating the people, during their days of rest, but which afterwards

                acquired so much celebrity in Greece; as in Italy the people were
                spectators only, and the contending parties held to be of a servile

                took its name from him, and which was the seat of the Luceres, from
                which the Etruscan origin of that tribe might be inferred; and the additions
                subsequently made to it by Tullus Hostilius, might be put
                down as a filling up of its number. Other stories there are, which
                seem to lead to the same general conclusion. There is much that can
                be said by those who believe in the existence of intimate relations
                between the Romans and the Etruscans; and equally true is it, that
                there is much that can be said by those who are of an opposite opinion.
                When we see how much the Romans had among them of an
                Etruscan character—that their ivory chairs, their robes of triumph,
                their lictors, and many other things appertaining to their magisterial
                honors and insignia, were borrowed from Etruria, and that they were
                of long continuance, ceasing only with an utter change of religion,
                institutions, and manners; and when we comprehend that the main
                political object aimed at by the patricians, was to introduce into Rome
                the same state of society that prevailed in the cities of Etruria, where
                the government was in the hands of an oligarchy, while the rest of
                the inhabitants were serfs;—when we reflect on these things, the
                impression left upon the mind is, that Etruria and Rome must have been
                intimately connected, and that the destined mistress of the world, was
                probably once an Etruscan city. Nor is this impression affected otherwise
                than to be strengthened, when we observe that the religion of
                Rome was permanently influenced by the Etruscan element, which predominated
                in it down to the hour of its extinction. The first religion
                of Rome, was plain in its nature and simple in its rites. It was of
                Sabine origin, and it was never wholly extinct. The augurate was a Sabine
                institution, and the opposition which the augur Attus Navius made
                to some of the proposed political changes of the elder Tarquin, may
                have been sharpened by the religious changes, either already effected,
                or dreaded, at the hands of the same monarch. Certain it is, that the
                religion of the Romans underwent a great change, and that which
                made it a most potent state engine, was the introduction of a more
                mystic creed and a more complex worship—one much more striking
                to the imagination, and more susceptible of being <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">used</span> for the benefit
                of an exclusive government, than that which previously prevailed.
                And we know that this religion had a great effect on the Romans—
                that it gave character as well to their daily life, as to their public acts
                —that its influence is to be seen throughout the whole history of that
                <span class="tei_span">people. Tarquinius removed the Sabine gods from the Capitoline, to
                make room for his temple, which was dedicated to the three deities—</span><span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_note_place_right tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_note_resp_h1 note"><span><span class="tei_span">Jupiter</span> </span></span><span class="tei_span">
                Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva—' whose worship, according to the Etruscan</span><span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_note_place_right tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_note_resp_h1 note"><span><span class="tei_span">Juno</span> </span></span><span class="tei_span">

                three gates duly consecrated, and three temples to these divinities.'
                How much of Hellenic influence there was in all this, no one can say,
                nor to what extent the Romans were indebted to the Etruscans for it.</span></span>
                ' But the science of the Haruspices, and especially the attention to
                signs in the sky, to thunder and lightning, seems to have been conducted
                according to the Etruscan ritual; perhaps also from the same
                source came that belief in the punishment of the wicked after death,

                to which Polybius ascribes so strong a moral influence over the minds of the Romans, even in his own days. And Etruscan rites and ordinances must have been widely prevalent in the Roman commonwealth, when, as some writers asserted, and Roman nobility were taught habitually the Etruscan language and when the senate provided by a special decree for the perpetual cultivation of the Etruscan discipline by young men of the highest nobility in Etruria; lest a science so important to the commonwealth should be corrupted by falling into the hands of low and mercenary persons.’ Considered in connection with this change from their primitive religion, to one of a more elaborate and recondite character, the story of the discovery of the religious books of Numa, towards the close of the sixth century of the city, and of their destruction by the prætor urbanus, ‘because their contents tended to overthrow the religious rites observed in Rome,’ becomes significant. Numa was a Sabine, and the founder of the old religion, which had been displaced by that of Etruria, the latter having endured more than four centuries at the time of the discovery of his books. To have promulgated their contents, would have been to convince the Romans how much they had changed from the creed of their ancestors, and might have led to a religious warfare, to something like the scenes that occurred at the suppression of the bacchanalian sect. The authorities prudently cosigned them to a safer grave than that from which they had been taken. They could not stand the ordeal of fire, unlike some pious works of more recent times. When we consider all these things, we are ready to assert that Etruria and Rome must have stood, at one time, in almost as intimate a relation to each other, as that of parent and child. But there is another point to be regarded, and which is of consequence enough to almost overthrow all the arguments that have been adduced in support of the position that Rome owed much to Etruria. How happens it, if the two countries were at one time so closely allied, there should be no traces—not the slightest—of the Etruscan language in that of the Romans? This seems almost sufficient to counterbalance all the proofs that have been adduced in support of the theory, that between the two countries, intimate relations for a considerable length of time subsisted. It does prove, that Rome must have arrived at a considerable height, before those relations commenced, and that, whatever their nature was, they had no power to affect the literature of Rome, at least in a direct manner. 
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">As respects the character of the age of the Roman monarchy, there are two opinions, each supported by great talent and extensive learning. Muller heads one school, and Niebuhr the other. The former, in his prize work on the Etruscans, supposes that the reigns of the Tarquins and Servius Tullius, represent the rule of the Etruscans in Rome, and all over Latium. The Tarquins he holds to have been Lucumones of the city of Tarquinii, which had acquired supremacy; while he also believes that their rule was for a time interrupted by that of Servius Tullius, or Mastarna, an Etruscan chief from Vulsinii, of a party hostile to the Lucumones, who were the patricians of Etruria.

                The Tarquins, according to this theory, were restored by the success of a conspiracy, the main features of which are represented in the poetical account of the assassination of Servius; and the restored house ruled more despotically than ever, as depicted in the history of Tarquin the Proud. The expulsion of the Tarquins represents the decline of Tarquinii, and the restoration to independence of the Latin portion of the kingdom, Rome having been in subjection, as a Latin city to the Etruscan city. Niebuhr, on the contrary, is of opinion that the Tarquinian dynasty were Latins, and he has made use of several strong arguments in support of his position. We cannot follow him in all that he says, as to do him justice would require far more room than we can now command. He conceives that ‘the supposition that the first Tarquinius was an Etruscan owed its origin solely to his name having been deduced from that of the Etruscan city;’ and it may be added, that he has completely demolished the old story by which that sovereign’s family was connected with Corinth. He admits, however, that the several representations respecting the connection of the Etruscans with the Romans, concerning which there are so many traditions, clearly imply ‘the notion that there was a time when Rome received Tuscan institutions from a prince of Etruria, and was the great and splendid capital of a powerful Etruscan state.’
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dr Arnold agrees with Muller, so far as to regard the reigns of the two Tarquinii as a period during which an Etruscan dynasty ruled in Rome, introducing Etruscan rites, arts, and institutions. ‘It is wholly another question,’ he adds, ‘whether these princes regarded Rome as their capital or Tarquinii; but the probability is, that they were kings of Rome, and they may very possibly have received the help of their Latin subjects even to make conquests for them in Etruria; just as the Norman kings of England soon found that England was more than Normandy, and Henry I conquered Normandy from his brother, chiefly by the help of English men and money. And yet we retain the marks of the Norman conquest impressed upon every part of our institutions down this very hour.’ This is very clearly and shrewdly put, and throws much light upon the subject under discussion, by a comparison with an event and its results well known to Americans and to Englishmen.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">The character of the public works of the Roman monarchy, is a strong proof in support of the opinion that the last kings were Etruscans. They were not only grand in their conception and execution, but they were also eminent, in many instances, for their usefulness, as the cloacæ, for example, and the embanking of the Tiber.

                it was not for idle purposes. So too and by means of like taskwork
                did Rome build, when governed by Etruscan kings: after she became
                free, all great works were at a stand, until the republic had grown
                rich by its victories and conquests: and when compared with her oldest
                works and with those of the Etruscan cities, the buildings of imperial
                Rome make but an inconsiderable figure.' As we find the public
                works of both countries having so many points in common, and as the
                spirit which dictated and animated those of Etruria, appears to have

                directed by the ruthless Sylla, were destined to cut her up, root and</span></span>

            <p class="tei_p">The war with Porsenna, as the account of it is given by the Romans,
                is fabulous. Nevertheless, that Rome was conquered by the Etruscans,
                a few years after the overthrow of the monarchy, is what cannot
                be doubted. There was an outbreak of the Etruscans against the
                Latin race, and Rome fell before their leader. Her senate sent him
                the usual tokens acknowledging the presence of sovereignty in the person
                receiving them—the throne of ivory, the sceptre, the triumphal
                robe, etc.,—and she was compelled to yield up a portion of her territory,
                to submit to a prohibition from using iron for other than agricultural
                purposes, and to give herself up as unreservedly to the will
                of the conqueror, as a plebeian debtor without means to his patrician
                creditor. Tacitus (Hist. iii, 72) emphatically says, that Rome surrendered
                to the Etruscan monarch. The Romans endeavored to
                smooth over the conquest of their city, in after times, and invented a
                variety of fables, the whole of which, even if they had been truths,
                would not have been so honorable to their ancestors, as the simple
                fact that they recovered their independence, though deprived of arms,
                and otherwise unfavorably situated. It has been finely said, that they
                were incapable of feeling that chains which are burst by our own
                might, are an ornament. The Etruscan invasion of Latium, appears
                to have been suddenly checked. At Aricia, the invaders were attacked
                by an allied force of Latins and Italian Greeks, by whom they
                were completely defeated, and their dominion confined to what was
                their own side of the Tiber. Rome, however, did not recover the
                territory that she had lost, and which loss is implied in the reduction
                of the Servian tribes from thirty to twenty.

                a portion of it, to the Roman agrarian laws, respecting which,
                Niebuhr, following in the track of Heyne, has written with much
                earnestness, with great learning, and with rare service to the cause of
                historical truth. Perhaps there are no more useful portions of his work,
                than those which relate to this subject. But the matter is one of too

There is nothing shallow, either, about Arnold’s work, its philosophy being as sound, and its facts as well authenticated, as any thing in Niebuhr himself. Clearness is not attained at the expense of profundity, nor learning sacrificed to the graces of style. We have all the points of the great philosophic historian, at the same time that we have elegance of expression and beauty of thought. Arnold’s style is, indeed, to us, the realization of the rhetoric of the Proverbs—words fitly spoken—‘apples of gold in pictures of silver.’ His chrystal purity is the emanation of a pure mind, and it will ever be admired by readers of taste and judgement. His work is based upon Niebuhr’s, but it has merits peculiarly its own. He is the Aaron of the German Moses, the man who stands up and developes the ideas of the leader of his school. He has been to Niebuhr, what Dumont was to Bentham, the expounder of great truths to the world, which the former had discovered, but could not convey to the common mind;—what the priestess was to the oracle—the tongue which conveys to the inquirer after truth, the response of the god, though without any of that mysticism or ambiguity which marked the words of the priestess of Delphi. 
            </p>
                <p class="tei_p">This difference between the works of the two illustrious men of whom we are speaking, when treating of the same subject, is said to be caused by the difference of political circumstances in which they were placed, and that it is characteristic of the scholars of the two countries—Niebuhr being the type of Germany, as Arnold is of England. The Englishman is made a practical man, because he is compelled to take no small part in an active life. He knows what men want, what they can understand, and acts accordingly. He also has a public appeal to—not merely a reading public, but a people of action, who are engaged in constantly superintending the machinery of a great nation governed by a free constitution. The German is in a situation radically different from this. His public duties are extremely limited. He is not brought down into the real world, but lives in a realm of his own creation; and when we know that the tendency of his intellect is to the mystic and dreamy, we can have no difficulty in seeing where he will bring up, when political circumstances give their impulsion to an idiosyncrasy requiring great restraint to keep its possessor from running, not only to the unintelligible, but also into the wild and the grotesque. The German writer has a much greater, a more learned, but a widely different reading public to appeal to, than has the Englishman,—but it is only a reading public, and not a thinking public, beyond its thoughts being directed merely to what it reads. What is there, in Germany, to give a masculine tone to the understanding, and clearness and vigor to the expression of its conceptions, like the Parliament, the hustings, the municipal and parochial, and other public business of England? Nothing that we are aware of—and there will be nothing, until the great German race, one of the noblest branches of the human family, shall return to the rock whence they

                were hewn. Liberty came from that region, and may we not hope
                that she will again occupy her original home, despite the broken vows
                of perjured kings? There is no people more capable of properly appreciating,
                and making a more noble use of free institutions, than the
                Germans, as all who know the conduct of that large portion of them
                who have emigrated to the United States, will most readily admit. It
                is not true, however, that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">all</span> German scholars, write in that obscure
                    style which characterizes some portions of the works of Niebuhr—
                that involved manner, which renders reading indeed a task. There are
                exceptions, and striking ones too, to the rule. Heeren is singularly
                clear, and easy of being understood, though writing on the most recondite
                of subjects. The brothers Schlegel are models of ease and perspicuity,
                and several of their works are, to use a significant but common
                word, very <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">readable</span>. The ' History of Literature,' by Frederick
                Schlegel, is one of the most captivating of books, and can be read with
                pleasure and profit, at every period of life. We know that these
                brothers have, by some, been pronounced superficial and shallow; but,
                though their writings are not absolutely faultless, yet we cannot refrain
                from expressing the wish, that superficiality and shallowness like
                theirs, were more common. Some of the German military writers, are
                eminently clear and instructive, as Clausewitz, Plotho, Muffling, and
                the Archduke Charles,—but this may be attributed to their lives having
                been more practical than those of mere literary men.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">We would not be understood as saying that Niebuhr is among those
                German historians, whose writings are particularly obscure. It is only
                when compared with the higher order of the historical writers of those
                countries which produce eminently clear-headed men, who nevertheless
                lack not genius, that we are impressed with the obscurity of his style,
                —with the Michelets, the Thierrys, the Bancrofts, the Arnolds, and
                the Prescotts. As compared with many of his own countrymen, his
                writings are models of clearness, absolutely limpid in their nature.
                He owes this, partly to the wise course of instruction pursued by
                his father, partly to a residence in Great Britain during his early
                years, and to his having taken a considerable share in active life.
                He filled, it is well known, more than one public station, and faithfully
                performed the duties thereof. Still, he was a dreamer, to no inconsiderable
                extent, and in his mind, the real gave way to the ideal.
                We see this in the views which he entertained of the Romans of the
                old republic, whom he appears to have looked upon as a superior
                order of beings, whose shadowy greatness struck him with awe. Despite
                his vast knowledge of their history, he most sincerely regarded
                them, from a moral point of view, as worthy of profound veneration!
                a monstrous error, for however much they may impress us with their
                intellectual supremacy, they should never be allowed to so dazzle our
                imagination, as to lead us to regard them as any thing other than a
                band of well organized and most successful robbers, from the first
                hour to the last day of their existence—as thorough in their love of
                plunder, during the days of Fabricius, as in those of Sylla and Catiline.
                But to Niebuhr's mind they came through the ivory gate of
