            <p>Talk with Elias Pierson, who was in China, in the rebel army, in Canton, and all <hi rend="underline">through</hi> the country:</p>
            
            <p><hi rend="underline">A religious building</hi>: There would be here and there in the
                cities a large long building, perhaps one or two hundred feet in length, perhaps
                even more, and fifty or sixty feet high.—Along the walls on both sides range
                the idols, gods, the "Joshes," mostly of wood, some of them small, some thirty feet
                high, carved, gilt, &amp;c.—Some are devils—some on
                horseback—some monsters, deformed persons, half-animals, <del rend="overstrike">fish</del> half fish, and so on.—The Chinese are around, with the priests, on their knees pattering, mummbling, &amp;c.</p>
            
            <p>The "Josh" is the Chinese idol, in wood or clay, in temples or dwelling houses.—It is the same, in general, as other pagan idols.—</p>

            <p><hi rend="underline">Slavery.</hi>—This exists in China.—It has no regard to color.—Nine tenths of the slaves are women and girls.—</p>
            
            <p>Polygamy also exists, among rich persons.—</p>

            <p><hi rend="underline">Chinese Army.</hi>—Two contending forces, arranged against each other, take it quite easy, adjust their dresses, use their fans if the weather be hot, and are quite careful not to have their faces injured.—They are dandy soldiers.—<del rend="overstrike">Often</del> An engagement may happen and <del rend="overstrike">not</del> no killed or wounded <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#km">be</unclear> the result.—</p>

            <p><hi rend="underline">Executions.</hi>—Criminals are executed in several ways.—A common mode is to set the victim in a sort of box which tightens around his neck and ankles, and compresses his body by degrees,<del rend="overstike">—</del> with a <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear">special</add> screw against his breast; thus squeezing him to death.—Sometimes may be seen twenty or thirty such victims, in rows dead or dying, with their eyes protruded and their tongues hanging out of their mouths.</p>

            <p><hi rend="underline">Lascars.</hi>—Once or twice a year, the Lascars have a characteristic spree.—They attire themselves fantastically, one has a chain around his neck, one around his waist, another around his ankles, and the others lead them through the streets, with dances and music.—And such music!—There are perhaps fifty or sixty primitive instruments, reeds, gongs, shells, &amp;c., all keeping in a wild sort of uniform <choice><sic>rythm</sic><corr>rhythm</corr></choice>.—The Lascars in

This is a gift to the Chinese Neptune, or to Pluto—that they may have grace at the hands of those deities in their voyages, or after all voyages are over.—</p>
