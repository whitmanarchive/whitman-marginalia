                    was long and doubtful. After many

                    conflict in the first half of the seventeenth
                    century. For thirty years the torrent of
                    war rolled hither and thither over the
                    soil of Germany. Freedom triumphed;
                    but the country was exhausted, physically
                    and intellectually. It was not until
                    the commencement of the last century
                    that the spirit of German poetry began to
                    revive. Things grow better by slow degrees.
                    A period of utter barrenness is

                <p class="tei_p">From Goethe and Schiller Mr. Longfellow
                    has taken but little; thinking, no
                    doubt, that all readers of poetry must be
                    familiar with authors so often talked of,
                    and so much translated. His extracts
                    from Goethe are introduced by a series of
                    sketches, descriptive and critical, selected
                    from different writers. The good-natured
                    Gleim informs us, how he was himself
                    reading the Musen-Almanach to a literary
                    circle at Weimar, when "a young
                    man, booted and spurred, in a short green
                    shooting-jacket, thrown open," enters
                    the room, and after listening a while,
                    "offers to relieve him, from time to time,
                    in reading aloud, lest he should be tired."
                    Accordingly, he takes up the book, and
                    at first all goes on swimmingly. "But
                    on a sudden, it was as as if some wild
                    and wanton devil had taken possession
                    of the young reader, and I thought I saw
                    the Wild Huntsman bodily before me.
                    He read poems that had no existence in
                    the Almanach; he broke out into all
                    possible modes and dialects. Hexameters,
                    iambics, doggerel verses, one after another,
                    or blended in strange confusion,
                    came tumbling out in torrents." He does
                    not spare even the worthy Gleim. "But

                    eggs of her own and other people's, and
                    hatches them with infinite patience; but
                    to whom it sometimes happens to have a

                    of his visitor by inquiring about the
                    weather in America. "The countenance

                    the sluices of his eloquence were soon

                    York, and praised the umbrellas which

                pernicious prejudices, overcoming
                narrow views, elevating the intellect, and

                protests against "all intermeddling with
                subjects that one does not understand;"
                and declares that "of all intermeddling
                bunglers, political bunglers are to him the
                most odious, for their handiwork involves
                thousands and millions in destruction."
                He says farther, "that he has uniformly
                refused to mix himself up with party politics:"
                as if the subjugation of his native
                country by a foreign despot, and its
                liberation by the enthusiastic movement
                of the whole German people, were mere
                issues of party politics, to which a literary

                            anxious and vigilant fidelity. His composition
                            presents everywhere an appearance
                            of effort, which at times renders it
                            even heavy. Yet its movement, if somewhat
                            tardy, is stately and majestic.
                            Richter has described it very happily.
                            "The perfection of pomp-prose we find
                            in Schiller: what the utmost splendor of
                            reflection in images, in fullness and antithesis
                            can give, he gives. Nay, often he
                            plays on the poetic strings with so rich
                            and jewel-loaded a hand, that the sparkling
                            mass disturbs, if not the playing,
                            yet our hearing of it."</span></p> <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_span">Whatever may be said (and we are far
                                from denying that much may be said with
                                truth) of Goethe's great breadth and variety,
                                there can be little doubt, that, least
                                among American readers, Schiller is now,
                                and will long continue to be, the favorite
                                German poet. It is, perhaps, for this
                                very reason, that Mr. Longfellow has
                                given us so few specimens of his works:
                                and those even not in most instances his
                                best productions. We have indeed the
                                "Song of the Bell," and the "Knight
                                Toggenburg," but we miss the "Hymn
                                to Joy," the "Gods of Greece," the "Diver,"</span></span>
                                "Thekla," and other poems which
                                the admirers of Schiller are accustomed
                                to regard as his masterpieces.</p>
                            <p class="tei_p">Goethe and Schiller have departed, and
                                left behind them no equal. Among the
                                most distinguished of their successors
                                may be reckoned Tieck, Chamisso, Uhland,
                                Schulze, Rückert, Heine, Hoffman,
                                and Frieligrath. Of these, no one, probably,
                                stands higher in the estimation of
                                his countrymen, than the Swabian poet,
                                Ludwig Uhland. His reputation rests
                                chiefly on his lyrical writings, which are
                                remarkable for depth of feeling and beauty
                                of poetical expression. He has little
                                humor. The perplexities and contrarieties
                                of life present themselves to him, not
                                under a ludicrous, but under a melancholy
                                aspect. Most of his pieces breathe a<span class="tei_cb"/>
                                spirit of serious and tender sadness: not
                                unfrequently he rises to cheerfulness, the
                                chastened joy of a mind accustomed to
                                sorrow; seldom, if ever, does he give
                                himself up to mirth and jollity. Yet in
                                his very sadness there is something
                                which elevates rather than depresses: it
                                is not weak or querulous, neither has it
                                a shade of misanthropy: it is rich in noble
                                thoughts, and full of faith and hope
                                and consolation. His soul is open to
                                every impression of nature: he discerns
                                the poetical elements which belong to
                                the commonest situations and incidents of
                                life. Everything which he contemplates,
                                becomes invested in his mind with a
                                beautiful halo of feeling and reflection.

                            his fanciful descriptions. We can hardly

                            without calling up to mental vision a
                            short, stumpy, obese personage, with
                            heavy face, bullet head, rolling gait, arrayed

                            of words, but prodigal of tobacco-smoke.
                            Our minds, once preoccupied with this
                            ludicrous image, become incapable of doing
                            justice to the countrymen of Erasmus

                            We forget the advanced civilization of
                            Holland, her education and intelligence,<span class="tei_cb"/>
                            her progress in the arts useful and ornamental,
                            her spirit of industry and enterprise,
                            her unconquerable love of freedom.
                            We forget that her people, few in numbers,
                            unused to war, unsupported by
                            foreign aid, maintained a seventy years'
                            struggle for their liberties against the
                            mightiest empire of the time; that they
                            afterwards contested with England long
                            and gloriously the supremacy of the
                            ocean; that their artists are inferior only
                            to the great masters of Italy; that their
                            scholars have been unsurpassed for genius
                            and erudition; that their writers on international
                            law are the acknowledged arbiters
                            of Europe. Why should we doubt
                            that a people who, against all disadvantages
                            of nature and of fortune, have been
                            able to achieve so much for themselves
                            and for the world, may possess all the
                            elements of poetry? Do we not find
                            among them, in their past and their present,
                            ardor of emotion, energy of will,
                            loftiness of purpose, an eye to discern
                            the beautiful, a head to understand the
                            true, and a heart to love the good? Nor
                            do they lack the necessary means of expression.
                            Their language, however rude
                            and vulgar it may sound, when spoken
                            by rude and vulgar men, (for such must
                            always be the speech of such men, whatever
                            the syllables they use,) is a highly
                            cultivated idiom, copious and flexible, the
                            appropriate and serviceable instrument of
                            the educated mind. A branch ot the great
                            Teutonic stock, it stands midway between
                            the German and the English, and may
                            safely be pronounced inferior to neither
                            in the most valuable qualities of a language.
                            Its excellences have been fully
                            proved by the numerous and able writers
                            who have used it. Certainly, if we may
                            judge of an author's merits by the affection
                            and enthusiasm which he awakens, we
                            <span class="tei_span">must assign a very high rank to the poets

                        <p class="tei_p">In Holland, as in every other country
                            of Europe, the eighteenth century was a
                            <span class="tei_span">barren age for poetry. Its close, however,
                            was marked here, as everywhere
                            else, by the introduction of a new order
                            of things. Among those who took an
                            active part in the revival of Dutch literature,
                            the most conspicuous undoubtedly
                            was Bilderdijk. Through a long career
                            of authorship he was distinguished for
                            his profound and various learning, for the
                            voluminous extent of his productions, for
                            his energetic independence, and for the
                            number and the bitterness of his literary
                            quarrels. The warmth of his feelings,
                            and the asperity of his satire, may be
                            well enough illustrated by these few
                            lines, in which, speaking of the French
                            language, he says:—</span></p></span>

                            the two great parts into which this work
                            may be divided—the one, which embraces
                            the poetry of the Teutonic languages; the
                            second part is occupied with the literature
                            of Southern Europe—of France, Italy,
                            Spain and Portugal, countries in which
                            are spoken languages derived from the
                            Latin. There are many things in this
                            part of the book, especially under Italian
                            poetry, which we should be glad to notice;
                            but we have already exceeded our
                            allotted limits, and forbear to trespass
                            farther at present on the patience of the

                            <p class="tei_p">[We give, in this number, the last chapter which we shall probably be able to present to
                                our readers, of the "Notes by the Road." We cannot but feel that they have gratified
                                many, where our Magazine is read; and we believe that they will learn with pleasure that
                                a portion of his sketches, including one or two of the chapters published in the Review, but
                                mainly on entirely fresh ground, may soon be given to the public. For a narrative of pleasant,
                                minute observations, written in a graceful, subdued style, slightly quaint, making the
                                reader an easy-minded companion of the rambling traveler—a style quite new under the
                                prevailing taste for rapid and vigorous writing—we venture to bespeak, we might say, predict,
                                beforehand, a most favorable reception. The writer's quick-eyed observations have
                                covered many parts of Europe; the green lanes, and by-ways, and busy thoroughfares of
                                England—the solitary heaths and hills of Scotland—the life led in London and Paris—the
                                quaint and simple forms of things in France and Dutch-land—the ever-great scenery of the
                                Alps—the scenes and associations, never yet exhausted, of "remembered Italy." With
                                such things to talk about, and a certain way of telling his story, we do not see why his should
                                not be a "proper book."—E<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">D</span>. A<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">M</span> R<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">EV</span>.]</p>

                                so I left him at Hamburg—at dinner
                                —at the table of the Kronprinzen
                                Charles, on the sunny side of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Jungfernstieg</span>.
                                There was, it is true, a great
                                deal to detain him in the old free city:—
                                there was the Alster, stretching out under
                                our chamber windows in a broad sheet,
                                with elegant new houses flanking it,
                                with little skiffs paddling over it, from
                                which the music floated up to our ears at
                                eventide; and beyond it was the belt of
                                road, along which dashing equipages ran
                                all day, and from which rose up out of the
                                very edge of the water, the great wind-mill
                                that flung the black shadows of its
                                slouching arms, half way to the 'maiden's
                                walk,' when the sun was riding over the
                                tops of the gardens of Vierland. Jenny
                                Lind was coming to sing to the Hamburgers,
                                and Cameron had secured a
                                seat: beside, there were two beautiful
                                Russian girls sitting <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">vis à vis</span> at the table
                                where I left him, and a Swedish bride as
                                pretty as the picture of Poliphar's wife in
                                the palace of Barberini at Rome. And
                                there was a gay little Prussian girl, who
                                could speak just enough English to enlist
                                the sympathies of my Scotch friend, and
                                to puzzle prodigiously her staid German
                                Papa. I know very well, by the mischief
                                that was in her eye, that she did not
                                translate truly to her Papa, all the little
                                gossip that passed between her and fun-
                                loving Cameron, or my friend would
                                have had, as sure as the world, a snatch
                                of the old man's cane. Whether it was
                                such company, or the "hung beef" that
                                held him, Cameron would not go with
                                me to Bremen.</p><span class="tei_cb"/>

      </span></span> at Hamburg myself.
                                It is a queer old city, lying just where the
                                Elbe, coming down from the mountains
                                of Bohemia through the wild gaps of
                                Saxony and everlasting plains of Prussia,
                                pours its muddy waters into a long
                                arm of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mer du Nord</span>. The new city,
                                built over the ruins of the fire is elegant,
                                and almost Paris-like; and out of it, one
                                wanders, before he is aware, into the
                                narrow alleys of the old Dutch gables.
                                And blackened cross beams, and overlapping
                                roofs, and diamond panes, and
                                scores of smart Dutch caps, are looking
                                down on him as he wanders entranced.
                                It is the strangest contrast of cities that
                                can be seen in Europe. One hour, you
                                are in a world that has an old age of
                                centuries:—pavement, sideways, houses,
                                everything old, and the smoke curling in
                                an old-fashioned way out of monstrous
                                chimney-stacks, into the murky sky:
                                five minutes' walk will bring one from
                                the midst of this into a region where all
                                is shockingly new;—Parisian shops, with
                                Parisian plate glass in the windows; Parisian
                                shopkeepers, with Parisian gold
                                in the till. The contrast was tormenting.
                                Before the smooth cut shops that are
                                ranged around the basin of the Alster,
                                one could not persuade himself that he
                                was in the quaint old Hanse town of
                                Jew brokers, and storks' nests, that he
                                had come to see; or when he wandered
                                upon the quays that are lined up and
                                down with such true Dutch-looking
                                houses, it would seem that he was out of
                                all reach of the splendid hotel of the
                                Crown Prince, and the prim porter who
                                sports his livery at the door. The</p>
