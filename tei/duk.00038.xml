            <cb/>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">PEOPLE</hi> seem to have an idea that facts are every
            thing in the business of the world&#x2014;the only 
            considerations in the philosophy of human progress.
            Opposed to what is merely imaginary, facts are
            allowed to have much dignity. Your practical
            reasoners look for facts; facts "are the jockies for 
            them"&#x2014;such as they can see, hear, handle, or 
            demonstrate; while the imaginations are mostly held
            synonymous with the worthless, the unsubstantial
            and the ridiculous. They seem to say in the spirit
            of one of Congreve's characters&#x2014;we forget which&#x2014;
            "fiddle-faddle, don't tell me of this and that and
            every thing in the world; but give me mathematical demonstration; but we
            think "under leave of Brutus and the rest," that
            facts do not seem, and have not seemed to be so 
            exclusively essential to "the cosmogony of the 
            world," to the history and progress of mind and the
            general business of things, as some solid authorities
            think. Without troubling our heads, in this gossiping 
            paper, with the subtleties of Berkley and others,
            who knock all creation into the compass of a man's 
            perceptions&#x2014;establish the column of the unsubstantial
            universe on the pentagonal base of the senses&#x2014;
            we have an idea that a vast amount of the fictitious 
            and imaginary is blended with our regular business
            of being, doing, and suffering. Human nature has, in
            all times, contrived a little gilding, to make the bitter 
            pill of life go down. Tasso truly says&#x2014;in his Invocation
            to the Virgin Mary for a muse&#x2014;at the opening
            of his "Gerusalemme Liberata"&#x2014;</p>
            <lb/>
            <lg><l>For well thou knowest, the world more fondly turns</l>
            <l>To old Parnassus' consecrated spot;</l>
            <l>And truths which graceful poetry adorns </l>
            <l>Win while they please us; and a spell is wrought</l>
            <l>For the most subtle and reluctant thought.</l>
            <l>Thus, for the sickly child, by friendly wile,</l>
            <l>The cup's deceptive edge, with sweetness fraught,</l>
                <l>Lures to the bitter potion&#x2014;he the while</l>
            <l>Drinks life and health from the judicious guile.</l></lg>
            <p>Not alone have the edges of the cup of life been
            touched in this way, but the contents of it have
            always been dashed with large doses of the same
            emollient. Reality is not such a delightful thing,
            after all. The false and the phantasmal have ever
            been considered the necessary complements, as it
            were, of our condition here.</p>
            <cb/>
            <p>If we take away from the amount of what the
            world possesses that which belongs and is due to the
            imagination merely&#x2014;what is not authentic, and
            could not be sworn to in a court of justice&#x2014;what
            will be left? Let us take it away&#x2014;and what then?
            There is a sudden solitude in the world. The beautiful 
            is vanished, and the hard, blank remnant of 
            things is full of gaps, and desert places, disastrous
            flaws and a strange silence. There is nothing now,
            but facts in this macrocosm. But, believe us, 't is a
            very rude, cold place to live in&#x2014;much worse than
            ever it was before; and that&#x2014;in the opinion of the
            pale pessimist over the way there&#x2014;was bad enough
            in all conscience. They who first found out this
            world, and roamed about on it, had scarcely called it
            very good when they began to make it better, by
            people its too extensive solitudes&#x2014;creating phantasms
            and imaginations for it, where there were
            none before. The unclothed reality of things was
            too bare and blank, beautiful as it was, for the first
            human beings that walked the earth. They looked
            to the elements, and the infinite host of heaven, and
            following their unanswerable instincts, they began
            to make mysteries, airy fabrics and visions. They 
            imagined a god for the cope and the clouds of the
            firmament, and he wielded the thunderbolts from a
            high mountain; another, shaped after the most
            perfectly formed of men, resided in the sun</p>

            <p>They heard gods in winds and in fire&#x2014;and altars
                <span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h3" xml:id="a1" from="#a1" to="#a2"/>to these were among the earliest raised. They saw
            a terrible divinity in the vastness or angry billows of
            the sea, and imagined a crowd of lesser beings to
            haunt its caverns and depths. The forests were
            sacred to the universal Pan&#x2014;his fauns, sylvans and
            satyrs; every oak had its hamadryad, every river
            its naiad or potamid; the oreads took charge of the
            flowery meadows, and the nap&#xe6;&#xe6; wandered forever
            in the shady valleys. Impatient of mere
            reality, men filled the universe with phantasies and
            theories&#x2014;</p>

            <p>Suppose we demolish all these graceful fallacies, 
            and the poetry, also, in which they are embalmed. 
            What a throng of splendid deeds, of heroic and beautiful 
            figures&#8212;demigods, warriors, kings&#8212;bright 
            women and brave men, moving in gorgeous panorama 
            over the vast back-ground of antiquity&#8212;is 
            extinguished in the darkness! The creations of the 
            ancient poets and imaginative writers have filled up a 
            space in the earlier ages of the world, which without 
            them would be a blank and lost to the human mind, 
            as much as the pre-Adamite chaos is. What a 
            disinheritance it would be to take away the Iliad and 
            Odyssey! to obliterate Hector, the kind-hearted and 
            manly hero; and Priam with his mighty sorrows a 
            suppliant for his dead son; and the warring Achilles&#8212;</p>
            <lg type="single-line"><l>"Impiger, iracundus, inexorabilis, acer,"</l></lg>
            <p>and the wandering Ulysses, seeing strange shores 
            and cities, and the varying manners of men! Not 
            alone would much be wanted in the want of these 
            venerable works, but in the want of all that literature 
            which they inspired and gave rise to in after 
            time. The succeeding poets and dramatists of 
            Greece and Rome drew light from Homer, as Milton's 
            stars did in their golden urns from the sun. 
            They took his historic imaginations and characters 
            as their models, and reproduced them in forms which 
            the world will not willingly let die, and which it 
            prizes nearly as much as the Institutes and Pandects 
            of Justinian, or any thing else of that authentic and 
            substantial kind.</p>
            <p>To come to our own familiar literature, the 
            fictions of our insular or continental writers are as 
            favorably and generally remembered as the historic 
            facts of the English-speaking peoples. In our genial 
            moments, when the mind desires to be refreshed or 
            pleased it will revert, with an almost universal 
            preference, to what is imaginary, or adorned with the 
            graces of imaginative literature; and half the world 
            regard with as much attention the men and women 
            of Shakspeare and Scott as those of Hume and Prescott. 
            And how intimately and lovingly we give our 
            interest to the words and actions of these imaginary 
            beings! What a world of thought and life is in the 
            dramas of <choice><orig>Shakspeare</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice>! There is the venerable 
            Lear, driven out into the storm, and talking the 
            finest philosophy to the wild elements, that so feelingly 
            persuade him what he is; and Hamlet, so 
            sententious in his antic disposition; the fair Ophelia, and 
            the prosy old courtier, Polonius; and the immortal 
            bed-presser, and huge hill of flesh&#8212;the greatest liar 
            and the greatest favorite in the world; and Macbeth, 
            with his terrible hags on the heath, and his more 
            terrible wife; and Richard, wooing Lady Anne, or 
            fighting desperately his last battle. Then there are 
            the witty and adventurous Rosalind, and</p>
            <lg type="single-line"><l>"The gentle lady wedded to the Moor;"</l></lg>
            <p>and Portia, the beautiful, wise young judge; and the<cb/>
            impassioned Juliet, with the southern lightnings in 
            her veins; and Miranda, the enchantress, of an 
            enchanted island&#8212;and all that magnificent array of 
            womanhood which reflects for ever the unequaled genius of 
            <choice><orig>Shakspeare</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice>.</p>
            <p>We have also the creations of Scott&#8212;coming 
            nearest of any to those of the great dramatic poet, 
            and enjoying even a more general popularity. 
            Successive generations prize them as an imperishable

            Neibuhr has got into our old history of Rome and
            laid about him like an iconoclast. He destroys a

            ages of Rome&#x2014;so wonderful and picturesque in our 
            school-boy days. He makes a solitude and calls it 
            truth. He demolishes Mars, Rhea Sylvia, Romulus
            and Remus and the Wolf&#x2014;Numitor, Evander, and so
            forth. Under the flourishing of his pen they make

            themselves into thin air in which they vanish. Then

            the Bridge and Sc&#xe6;vola at the flaming Altar&#x2014;all are
            inventions of Fabius Pictor, Ennius, N&#xe6;vius, and
            others. This portion of the history of Rome, says
            the German, should be called the Lay of the Tarquins,
            and is just as authentic as the Lay of the Nibelungen!

            brilliant. Thus we have a vast amount of what is 
            called ancient history confounded with the professed
            creations of fanciful minds; and there does not seem
            to be any very marked difference between Agamemnon
            or Ajax, and Cecrops or Codrus; between
            &#xc6;neas or Dido, and Numa or Clelia&#x2014;they are all
            equally distinct or indistinct. Scott's King Richard,
            singing a roundelay and exchanging a buffet with the 
            Clerk of Copmanhurst, is as firm on the canvas as
            Alfred baking his cakes, or Canute sitting on a chair
            to rebuke his flatterers on the sea-shore.</p>
            <p>And even as regards the more modern and authentic
            annals of history, we do not think they have
            paid much more respect to the actual truth of things

                than do the fictionists. Sir Robert Walpole used to
            say to his friends, "Don't read history; that <hi rend="underline" hand="#h3">must</hi> 
            be false." And Sir Walter Raleigh, looking from the
            window of his prison in the Tower, and witnessing<anchor xml:id="b2"/>
            a quarrel in the court-yard or the street, and the after-
            testimony of the by-standers respecting it, was
            tempted, it is said, to throw his History of the 
            World into the fire, in despair of ever being able to
            gather any thing like truth from conflicting authorities.
            And, certainly, the differences of historians&#x2014;
            their doubts concerning motives, and their disagreements
            concerning facts, tend to give us very unsettled 
            ideas of history in general. Writers have 
            sent Col. Kirke down to us from the James the Second's
            reign with a very black and bloody renown. But
            he was not half so black as he was painted by the
            whigs; and the story of the poor girl whose husband
            he hanged before her eyes, in the morning, though she
            dearly purchased his life on Kirke's own terms, is
            pronounced by Ritson to be an impudent and bare-faced

                lie. The story is much older than Kirke.
            Richard the Third is also one of the historical
            reprobates; though it is not unlikely that the young
            princes were not murdered in the Tower, and that
            Perkin Warbeck was really the prince after all; as
            truly as the surreptitious, warming-pan prince is

                of the feudal system still strong in the nation,

            fancies and after-thoughts of the narrators, or fabricated
            wilfully for a purpose. We need not go very
            far back in history to discover the truth of this. In a

                <span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h3" xml:id="e1" from="#e1" to="#e2"/>
                Restorations," we are told that an old story of the 
            consternation of the members of the Directory, on its
            violent dissolution by Bonaparte, in 1800, was a false 
            one. There was no hurry-skurry, nor jumping out
            of windows, any more than when Oliver Cromwell
            put an end to the Long Parliament. Again, that

            terribly damaged, this ship sunk with all on board,
            her flag flying, and the crew shouting, "Long live
            the republic!" Carlyle adopted this version in his 
            history, and makes quite a cartoon of it, in his own
            outlandish phraseology. But on the appearance of
            the story in an English work, a naval officer who
            witnessed the affair of the <hi rend="italic">Vengeur</hi>, wrote a letter to
            the Times, in which he stated that, instead of going

                character of history. He had little of the 
                industry of Gibbon, and trusted very much to his own
                sagacity for his views. He was also a tory, and became,
                in his scorn for whiggery, the apologist of the 
                Stuarts. His history is charming as a composition,
                but errs in its colorings of facts and its conclusions
                from them.</p>

                Imagination, as we have said, seems the complement
                of the world of facts and things, in all mental
                exercises, except the logical and mathematical. If
                we contemplate nature it enhances what we behold.
                <hi rend="underline">The mountains, rivers, forests, and the elements that
                gird them round about, would be only blank conditions of matter, if the mind did not fling its own

                Nature was thus endowed 
                from the beginning&#x2014;when men heard voices in the
                winds, and the supernatural inhabitants of terra

                <p>And the modern lovers of nature, though they no
                longer recognize the mythologic people of the ancient
            beliefs in her picturesque wildernesses, clothe them
            with the attributes of the mysterious abstract power
            which is over all things. And, in the towering of her
            peaks, the murmur of her forests and seas, the roar of
            her storms, the singing of her nightly stars, they find
            revelations and prophecies of higher and farther existences.
            In this respect, the modern poetry of nature 
            has a nobler scope and purer inspiration than the 
            ancient. Wordsworth and Byron speculate more
            sublimely than Lucretius.</p>
            <p>In another sense, the imagination materially 
            imposes upon facts. <hi rend="underline" hand="#h3">In contemplating cities, works of
            art, ruins, or scenes of nature, we almost always

                Campbell says very well, that distance lends 
                enchantment to the view, and it is generally true of 
                the human mind that it regards the past with a
                feeling of tenderness&#x2014;a disposition to make the best
                of it. There is a certain charm in Time, whom we
                regard as the dominator of us all; and the ruins or
                remnants of any thing speak an impressive warning
                of our own evanescent fate. That belief in the
                good old time is an instinct too strong for the 
                philosophy of most of us. <hi rend="underline">We have a thousand proofs

            <p>Any thing old or historic is appreciated in proportion
                to the scope it gives to the imagination&#x2014;to
            point a moral or adorn a tale. We gaze on the
            wild hill, vale, stream or forest of a new country,
            with none of those feelings which fill us in beholding
            similar objects in an old land. The former may be
            as fair or fairer to see: but, as</p>

            <p>of whom Wordsworth speaks, so the latter is a
            stream, a forest, a hill&#x2014;nothing more. The nameless
            savages had the palce from the beginning, and
            the solitude. The other is a tradition, a romance,
            a memory. <hi rend="underline" hand="#h3">In the valley is the legendary well, and

            where a king fell fighting, a thousand years ago;
            and, on the slope of the hill stand the Druid stones,
            in a circle, set there, certainly, in the ancient time

            <p>They receive all their witchery from the imagination
            of him who surveys them. This faculty is 
            potentially mingled with all that is most real in nature;
            nay, it would seem to be as much a reality as any 
            thing else we call such. The preacher calls the
            world a vain shadow, and <hi rend="underline" hand="#h3">the Berkleyan philosopher
            calls it a huge accident of the five</hi> senses; and

                </choice> is inclined to think there is nothing
            that is but thinking makes it so. The practical
            men, therefore,&#x2014;the directors of railways, the
            managers of stock, and the owners of electric telegraphs
            cannot be considered to have matters all to
            themselves. The poet and the romanticist control as 
            much of the "thick rotundity of the world" as they;
            and certainly the most enchanting portion. Schiller
            gives us in an admired lyric, the idea that the imaginative
            being was forgotten by Jove in the <span rend="singleLine-left" hand="#h3" xml:id="p1" from="p1" to="p2"/>distribution
                of the earth; but received a general invitation
            to the Court of Olympus. Our nether "maker,"
            or "finder," does still, of course, avail himself of this
            privilege; but not as one without alternative. He
            has a great share and dominion in all sublinary
            things; and his castles in the air may be found as 
            firmly fixed, after all, and as well tenanted, as any
