            <note type="project" target="#dat1">This manuscript consists of a backing sheet with two smaller manuscript scraps pasted on, which together, at one time, likely formed part of <ref target="../manuscripts/marginalia/scrapbook_index">Whitman's cultural geography scrapbook</ref>. The pasted-on manuscript scraps were originally part of the notebook "<ref target="../../notebooks/transcriptions/loc.05589.html">women</ref>," which probably dates from about 1854 to about 1860. Prose notes written on the back of the bottom paste-on relate to what became section 2 of "I Sing the Body Electric," first published as the fifth poem in the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. Both manuscript scraps were probably written shortly before or early in 1855, though the notes on the backing sheet to which they have been pasted may have been written at a later date.</note>

               <note type="project" target="#rel01 #rel02 #rel03">Both scraps of paper pasted onto this page have writing on the reverse. The scraps originally formed part of a larger notebook. It is possible that the notes about Hercules and Troy written on the front of the bottom paste-on, which would have been the only vertically oriented text in the notebook, were added after the page was removed from the notebook. However, we have made <ref target="../../notebooks/loc.05589/images_short/index.html">composite images</ref> that show the continuation of the text on the reverse of both paste-ons with the notebook leaves from which they were cut, and the manuscripts have been transcribed in separate files.</note>
