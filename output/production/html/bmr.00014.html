            <p class="tei_p">family against family, tribe against tribe; and the earth is 
            become a theatre of blood, of discord, and of rapine. By 
            ignorance and cupidity, a secret war, fermenting in the bosom 
            of every state, has separated citizen from citizen; and the 
            same society has divided itself into oppressors and oppressed, 
            into masters and slaves; by these, the heads of a nation, 
            sometimes insolent and audacious, have forged its chains 
            within its own bowels; and mercenary avarice has founded 
            political despotism. Sometimes, hypocritical and cunning, 
            they have called from heaven a lying power, and a sacrilegious 
            yoke; and credulous cupidity has founded religious despotism. 
            By these have been perverted the ideas of good and evil, just 
            and unjust, vice and virtue; and nations have wandered in a 
            labyrinth of errors and calamities.</p>

            glorious, and converted the splendor of a populous city into 
            a solitude of mourning and of ruins! But as in the bosom of

         <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><span class="tei_span">Sacred impostors</span></span><span class="tei_span">, in other countries, tending by other 
        means to the same object, abused the credulity of the ignorant. 
        In the gloom of their temples, behind the curtain of the 
        altar, they made their gods act and speak; gave forth oracles, 
        worked miracles, ordered sacrifices, levied offerings, 
        prescribed endowments; and, under the names of theocracy and 
        of religion, the state became tormented by the passions of the 
        priests.</span></p> <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_span">Sometimes a nation, weary of its dissensions or of its 
        tyrants, to lessen the sources of evil, submitted to a single</span></span> 
        master; but if it limited his powers, his sole aim was to 
        enlarge them; if it left them indefinite, he abused the trust 
        confided to him; and, under the name of monarchy, the state 
        was tormented by the passions of kings and princes.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Then the factions, availing themselves of the general 
        discontent, flattered the people with the hope of a better master; 
        dealt out gifts and promises, deposed the despot to take his 
        place; and their contests for the succession, or its partition, 
        tormented the state with the disorders and devastations of 
        civil war.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In fine, among these rivals, one more adroit, or more 
        fortunate, gained the ascendency, and concentrated all power 
        within himself. By a strange phenomenon, a single individual 
        mastered millions of his equals, against their will and without 
        their consent; and the art of tyranny sprung also from 
        cupidity.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In fact, observing the spirit of egotism which incessantly 
        divides mankind, the ambitious man fomented it with dexterity, 
        flattered the vanity of one, excited the jealousy of another, 
        favored the avarice of this, inflamed the resentment of that, 
        and irritated the passions of all; then, placing in opposition 
        their interests and prejudices, he sowed divisions and hatreds, 
        promised to the poor the spoils of the rich, to the rich the 
        subjection of the poor; threatened one man by another, this 
        class by that; and insulating all by distrust, created his 
        strength out of their weakness, and imposed the yoke of 
        opinion, which they mutually riveted on each other. With the

           that he loves and hates alternately; that he punishes or

           punishes the evils he permits; that he foresees but hinders 
           not crimes; that, like a corrupt judge, he is bribed by offerings; 
           like an ignorant despot, he makes laws and revokes 
           them; that, like a savage tyrant, he grants or resumes favors 
           without reason, and can only be appeased by servility. Ah! 
           now I know the lying spirit of man! Contemplating the 
           picture which he hath drawn of the Divinity: No, said I, it is not 
           God who hath made man after the image of God; but man 
           hath made God after the image of man; he hath given him 
           his own mind, clothed him with his own propensities; 
           ascribed to him his own judgments. And when in this 
           medley he finds the contradiction of his own principles, with 
           hypocritical humility, he imputes weakness to his reason, and 
           names the absurdities of his own mind the mysteries of God.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">He hath said, God is immutable, yet he offers prayers to 
           change him; he hath pronounced him incomprehensible, yet 
           he interprets him without ceasing.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_span">Imposters have arisen on the earth who have called themselves 
           the confidants of God; and, erecting themselves into 
           teachers of the people, have opened the ways of falsehood 
           and iniquity; they have ascribed merit to practices indifferent 
           or ridiculous; they have supposed a virtue in certain postures, 
           in pronouncing certain words, articulating certain names; 
           they have transformed into a crime the eating of certain 
           meats, the drinking of certain liquors, on one day rather than 
           another. The Jew would rather die than labor on the </span></span>
           sabbath; the Persian would endure suffocation, before he 
           would blow the fire with his breath; the Indian places 
           supreme perfection in besmearing himself with cow-dung, and 
           pronouncing mysteriously the word Aûm;  <a id="ref#n1" class="inlinenote" href="#n1">*</a>  the Mussulman</p>

              * This word is, in the religion of the Hindoos, a sacred emblem of the Divinity. 
           It is only to be pronounced in secret, without being heard by any one. It is 
           formed of three letters, of which the first, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">a</span>, signifies the principal of all, the

           destroyer, who puts an end to all, Chiven. It is pronounced like the monosyllable

                    engaging in a war for them, and that at a time when revolution in their own 
                    country was just at its commencement. A man, who perceived the true nature 
                    of the situation, wrote a book to dissuade them from the war: it was immediately 
                    pretended that he was paid by the government, which in reality wished the war, 
                    and which was upon the point of shutting him up in a state prison. Another man 
                    wrote to recommend the war: he was applauded, and his word taken for the 
                    science, the politeness, and importance of the Turks. It is true that he believed 
                    in his own thesis, for he has found among them people who cast a nativity, and 
                    alchymists who ruined his fortune; as he found Martinists at Paris, who enabled 
                    him to sup with Sesostris, and Magnetizers who concluded with destroying his 
                    existence. Notwithstanding this, the Turks were beaten by the Russians, and 
                    the man who then predicted the fall of their empire, persists in the prediction. 
                    The result of this fall will be a complete change of the political system, as far as it 
                    relates to the coast of the Mediterranean. If, however, the French become 
                    important in proportion as they become free, and if they make use of the advantage 
                    they will obtain, their progress may easily prove of the most honorable sort; 
                    inasmuch as, by the wise decrees of fate, the true interest of mankind evermore 
                    accords with their true morality.

                Jesus. Acknowledging the same God with the Mussulmans, 
                founding their belief on the same books, admitting, like them, 
                a first man who lost the human race by eating an apple, they 
                hold them, however, in a holy abhorrence; and, out of pure 
                <span class="tei_span">piety, they call each other impious blasphemers.</span></p> <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_span">The great point of their dissension consists in this, that 
                after admitting a God </span><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><span class="tei_span">one and indivisible</span></span><span class="tei_span">, the Christian divides 
                him into three persons, each of which he believes to be a 
                complete and entire God, without ceasing to constitute an 
                identical whole, by the indivisibility of the three. And he 
                adds, that this being, who fills the universe, has reduced 
                himself to the body of a man; and has assumed material, 
                perishable, and limited organs, without ceasing to be immaterial, 
                infinite, and eternal. The Mussulman, who does not 
                comprehend these mysteries, rejects them as follies, and the </span></span>
                visions of a distempered brain; though he conceives perfectly 
                well the eternity of the Koran, and the mission of the prophet: 
                hence their implacable hatreds.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Again, the Christians, divided among themselves on many 
                points, have formed parties not less violent than the Mussulmans 
; and their quarrels are so much the more obstinate, as 
                the objects of them are inaccessible to the senses, and 
                incapable of demonstration: their opinions, therefore, have no 
                other basis but the will and caprice of the parties. Thus, 
                while they agree that God is a being incomprehensible and
                unknown, they dispute, nevertheless, about his essence, his</p>

            reason a respectful silence; but this more fully demonstrates 
            its revelation, since the human mind could never have 
            imagined such mysteries."</p>
                 <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_span">Then, holding the Bible in one hand and the four Gospels

            God, after passing an eternity in idleness, took the resolution, 
            without any known cause, of making the world out of nothing; 
            that having created the whole universe in six days, he found 
            himself fatigued on the seventh; that having placed the first 
            human pair in a garden of delights, to make them completely 
            happy, he forbade their tasting a particular fruit which he 
            placed within their reach; that these first parents, having 
            yielded to the temptation, all their race (which were not yet 
            born) had been condemned to bear the penalty of a fault 
            which they had not committed; that, after having left the 
            human race to damn themselves for four or five thousand 
            years, this God of mercy ordered a well beloved son, whom 
            he had engendered without a mother, and who was as old as 
            himself, to go and be put to death on the earth; and this for 
            the salvation of mankind; of whom much the greater portion, 
            nevertheless, have ever since continued in the way of perdition; 
            that to remedy this new difficulty, this same God, born 
            of a virgin, having died and risen from the dead, assumes a 
            new existence every day, and in the form of a piece of bread, 
            multiplies himself by millions at the voice of one of the basest 
            of men. Then, passing on to the doctrine of the sacraments, 
            he was going to treat at large on the power of absolution 
            and reprobation, of the means of purging all sins by a little

                    to the progress of the political relations between your ancestors

                        a compilation made by the elders of the people and the Seventy, who, after the 
                        death of Moses, collected his scattered ordinances, and mixed with them things 
                        that were extraneous: similar to what happened as to the Koran of Mahomet.

                        exhibit in an analysis of the book of Genesis, in which I shall demonstrate that 
                        the tenth chapter, among others, which treats of the pretended generations of the

                        the Hebrews at the epoch of the captivity, which was bounded by Greece or 
                        Hellas at the West, mount Caucasus at the North, Persia at the East, and 
                        Arabia and Upper Egypt at the South. All the pretended personages from Adam 
                        to Abraham, or his father Terah, are mythological beings, stars, constellations, 
                        countries. Adam is Bootes: Noah is Osiris: Xisuthrus Janus, Saturn; that is to 
                        say Capricorn, or the celestial Genius that opened the year. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Alexandrian

                    emblems, under which are enveloped ingenious ideas of 
                    morals, and the knowledge of the operations of nature in the 
                    action of the elements and the movement of the planets.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">"The truth is, that all is reduced to nothing—that all is 
                    illusion, appearance, dream; that the moral metempsychosis 
                    is only the figurative sense of the physical metempsychosis, 
                    or the successive movement of the elements of bodies which 
                    perish not, but which, having composed one body, pass when 
                    that is dissolved, into other mediums and form other 
                    combinations. The soul is but the vital principle which results 
                    from the properties of matter, and from the action of the 
                    elements in those bodies where they create a spontaneous 
                    movement. To suppose that this product of the play of the 
                    organs, born with them, matured with them, and which sleeps 
                    with them, can subsist when they cease, is the romance of 
                    a wandering imagination, perhaps agreeable enough, but 
                    really chimerical.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">God itself is nothing more than the moving principle, the 
                    occult force inherent in all beings—the sum of their laws and</p>

                    this distinction? It is, that as the public doctrine recommends offerings, expiations, 
                    endowments, etc., the priests find their profit in preaching it to the people; 
                    whereas the other, teaching the vanity of worldly things, and attended with no 
                    lucre, it is thought proper to make it known only to adepts. Can the teachers 
                    and followers of this religion be better classed than under the heads of knavery

            <div class="">
                <p class="tei_p">are constantly galling your neighbors. When you criminate 
                    so severely the great man whom we revere, we might fairly 
                    retort on the conduct of him whom you adore; but we scorn 
                    such advantages, and confining ourselves to the real object in 
                    question, we maintain that the morals of your gospel have by 
                    <span class="tei_span">
                    no means that perfection which you ascribe to them; it is not 
                    true that they have introduced into the world new and 
                    unknown virtues: for example, the equality of men in the sight 
                    of God,—that fraternity and that benevolence which follow 
                    from it, were formal doctrines of the sect of the Hermatics or 
                    Samaneans,</span> <a id="ref#n11" class="inlinenote" href="#n11"><span class="tei_span">*</span></a> <span class="tei_span"> from whom you descend. As to the forgiveness 
                    of injuries, the Pagans themselves had taught it; but in the 
                    extent that you give it, far from being a virtue, it becomes an 
                    immorality, a vice. Your so much boasted precept of turning 
                    one cheek after the other, is not only contrary to every 
                    sentiment of man, but is opposed to all ideas of justice. It 
                    emboldens the wicked by impunity, debases the virtuous by 
                    servility, delivers up the world to despotism and tyranny, and 
                    dissolves all society. Such is the true spirit of your doctrines. 
                    Your gospels in their precepts and their parables, never represent 
                    God but as a despot without any rules of equity; a 
                    partial father treating a debauched and prodigal son with 
                    more favor than his respectful and virtuous children; a capricious 
                    master, who gives the same wages to workmen who 
                    had wrought but one hour, as to those who had labored 
                    through the whole day; one who prefers the last comers to
                    the first. The moral is everywhere misanthropic and anti-</span></span>social; it disgusts men with life and with society; and tends

                    persecutions of pretended heretics, your crusades against

                    answer of a Spartan whom a priest wanted to confess. "Is it to you or to God 
                    I am to confess?" "To God," answered the priest: "In that case," replied the

                    Christians confessed their faults publicly, like the Essenians. Afterwards, priests 
                    began to be established, with power of absolution from the sin of idolatry. In the 
                    time of Theodosius, a woman having publicly confessed an intrigue with a deacon, 
                    bishop Necterius, and his successor Chrysostom, granted communion without 
                    confession. It was not until the seventh century that the abbots of convents 
                    exacted from monks and nuns confession twice a year; and it was at a still later 
                    period that bishops of Rome generalized it.</p>

                        on the other hand, how can an honest woman consent to reveal them?</p>
