        (name of New York City
        The name of "New York," given
        in 16  , was also given intent intended
        also a slur and insult to upon
        the Hollandic race. It was not
        only a compliment to the Duke
        of York, as (Charles's brother,) but
        a spite at insulting to the Dutch, whom
        the Duke of York as Admiral, had
            attacked with the English fleet in their naval power
        (June 3d, 1665,) and had a fierce
        battle, each side claiming the
        advantage—though it probably
        lay with the Dutch.
