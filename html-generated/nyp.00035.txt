                References here are to George Grote's History of Greece, published between 1851 and 1859 by Harper's; and C.C. Felton's Greece, Ancient and Modern, first published in 1866 by Houghton, Mifflin, and Company. Dating this piece is difficult; Grier estimates that the notes were written after 1873 (Walt Whitman: Notebooks and Unpublished Manuscripts, ed. Edward F. Grier [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 5:1890).
