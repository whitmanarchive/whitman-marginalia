                HOW AMERICA WAS PEOPLED—Rev. Dr. Hawks,
                a learned and eloquent scholar, has recently
                been delivering a series of lectures, intended to
                show that this continent was peopled by successive
                migrations from the old world, at different
                eras and by different races. First from the shores
                of the Mediterranean, which was the earliest
                seat of commercial enterprise, and the people
                from which have left their record upon the vast
                ruins of Yucatan; next from China and Japan
                to Mexico, Central and South America, and next
                from Northern Asia, from which the American
                tribes of Indians came. Those theories are sustained
                by remarkable analogies between the
                languages prevailing in different parts of the
                Eastern continent with those to be found on this
                continent.
