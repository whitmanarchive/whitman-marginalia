General Hancock, commanding Second Corps, was then at Uniontown, but moved up to Tanytown the same morning, where General Meade then was. About noon of the 1st of July General Meade received word of General Reynold's death. He sent at once for General Hancock and directed him to proceed to the battle-field and assume command of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the forces there. When General Hancock arrived upon the field he relieved General Howard of the command, in accordance with General Meade's instructions, although General Howard was his senior. At that moment the greater portion of our troops were in full retreat through the town of Gettysburg, with the enemy pursuing. General Hancock directed that all should halt and reform upon Cemetery Hill. Many of them were passing <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> Cemetery Hill and marching down the Baltimore pike. These were recalled and placed in line of battle on Cemetery Hill.  In this manner <hi rend="italic">the advance of the enemy was checked. Troops were sent to occupy "Culp's Hill" and "Round Top," and the general line of battle was taken on which the fight was made during the two succeeding days.</hi></p> <p>A message was immediately sent by General Hancock to General Meade <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">to the effect that</unclear> he (General Hancock) considered Gettysburg, the line he then held, the proper place to fight our battle with Lee, and advising General Meade to order our entire army to that point.</p> <p>July 2d, at Gettysburg, General Hancock commanded the right centre of our army, and repulsed the assault made by the enemy on the Third Army Corps, by which that corps was broken and compelled to retire. He also assumed command of the Third Corps after General Sickles was wounded.</p> <p>July 3d, the troops under General Hancock received and repulsed the grand assault made by Lee on our line by a column of the enemy 18,000 strong. This was one of the most desperate and bloody assaults made during the war, and its repulse decided the battle of Gettysburg in our favor. <hi rend="italic">The enemy retreated that night!</hi> Five thousand prisoners, 37 colors, and many thousand stands of small arms were captured by our troops.</p> <ab><hi rend="center">HIS HONORABLE SCARS.</hi></ab> <p>While leading a line of battle against the enemy on that occasion General Hancock received a most dangerous wound, and fell from his horse at the moment of our victory. His life was despaired of for many months.</p> <p>When General Meade received word from General Hancock, on the 3d of July, that the enemy's attack had been repulsed, and that the victory was ours, he returned the following message to General Hancock: "Say to General Hancock that I regret exceedingly that he is wounded, and that I thank him for the country and for myself for the services he has rendered to-day."</p> <p>At the battle of the Wilderness, May 5-6, 1864, under General Grant, General Hancock commanded about 60,000 men; his own corps&#8212;Second and Third consolidated&#8212;and portions of Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth. He attacked the enemy there at 4:30 P.M. on the evening of the 5th of May, and continued the battle until dark; renewed it the next morning at daybreak, and was engaged nearly the whole of the 6th. The enemy withdrew on the night of the 7th. The troops under General Hancock bore the great brunt of the fighting of that battle.</p></add>
