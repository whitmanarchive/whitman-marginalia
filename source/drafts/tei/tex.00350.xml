                                years ago, and that the dates of his birth and death are not
                                exactly known. The date of his birth is not exactly known,
                                but that of his death is. Omar left the Nishapur College in
                                1042, corrected the Calendar during Malik Shah's reign (1072-
                                92), and died in 1124, over one hundred years of age, at Nishapur,
