            The reader leaps from sentence to sentence, as from one
            stepping stone to another, while the stream of the story
            rushes past unregarded. The Bhagvat-Geeta is less sententious
            and poetic, perhaps, but still more wonderfully
            sustained and developed. Its sanity and sublimity have
            impressed the minds even of soldiers and merchants. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2">It

            and to the wise wisdom; as either the traveller may wet
            his lips, or an army may fill its water casks at a full
            stream.</span></p>
            <p class="tei_p">One of the most attractive of those ancient books that I
            have met with is the Laws of Menu. According to Sir

            deduced from it, the revealed system of medicine, the
            Puranas, or sacred histories, and the code of Menu, were
            four works of supreme authority, which ought never to be
            shaken by arguments merely human." The last is believed
            by the Hindoos "to have been promulged in the beginning
            of time, by <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2 tei_hi_xml:id_u1">Menu, son or grandson of Brahma,"</span> and

            which Menu explained to the primitive world in the very
            words of the book now translated." Others affirm that

                    awaken us before dawn, and its influence lingers around
                    us like a fragrance late into the day. It conveys a new
                    gloss to the meadows and the depths of the wood. Its
                    spirit, like a more subtile ether, sweeps along with the
                    prevailing winds of a country, and the very locusts
                    and crickets of a summer day are but later or earlier
                    glosses on the Dherma Sastra of the Hindoos, a continuation
                    of the sacred code. As we have said, there is
                    an orientalism in the most restless pioneer, and the farthest
                    west is but the farthest east. This fair modern
                    world is only a reprint of the Laws of Menu with the
                    gloss of Culluca. Tried by a New England eye, or the
                    mere practical wisdom of modern times, they are the
                    oracles of a race already in its dotage, but held up to the
                    sky, which is the only impartial and incorruptible ordeal,
                    they are of a piece with its depth and serenity, and I am
                    assured that they will have a place and significance as
                    long as there is a sky to test them by.</p>

                    There must be a kind of life and palpitation to it,

                    It is wonderful that this sound should have come down
                    to us from so far, when the voice of man can be heard
                    so little way, and we are not now within ear-shot of any
                    contemporary. The woodcutters have here felled an ancient
                    pine forest, and brought to light to these distant hills
                    a fair lake in the south-west; and now in an instant it is
                    distinctly shown to these woods as if its image had travelled
                    hither from eternity. Perhaps these old stumps upon
                    the knoll remember when anciently this lake gleamed in
                    the horizon. One wonders if the bare earth itself did not
                    experience emotion at beholding again so fair a prospect.</p>

                    <p class="tei_p">That fair water lies there in the sun thus revealed, so
                    much the prouder and fairer because its beauty needed
                    not to be seen. It seems yet lonely, sufficient to itself,
                    and superior to observation.—So are these old sentences
                    like serene lakes in the south-west, at length revealed to
                    us, which have so long been reflecting our own sky in
                    their bosom.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">The great plain of India lies as in a cup between the
                    Himmaleh and the ocean on the north and south, and the
                    Brahmapootra and Indus, on the east and west, wherein
                    the primeval race was received. We will not dispute the
                    story. We are pleased to read in the natural history of
                    the country, of the "pine, larch, spruce, and silver fir,"
                    which cover the southern face of the Himmaleh range; of
                    the "gooseberry, raspberry, strawberry," which from an
                    imminent temperate zone overlook the torrid plains. So
                    did this active modern life have even then a foothold and
                    lurking place in the midst of the stateliness and contemplativeness
                    of those eastern plains. In another era the
                    "lily-of-the valley, cowslip, dandelion," were to work their
                    way down into the plain, and bloom in a level zone of
                    their own reaching round the earth. Already has the era
                    of the temperate zone arrived, the era of the pine and the
                    oak, for the palm and the banian do not supply the wants
                    of this age. The lichens on the summits of the rocks
                    will perchance find their level ere long.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">As for the tenets of the Brahmans, we are not so much
                    concerned to know what doctrines they held, as that they
                    were held by any. We can tolerate all philosophies, Atomists,
                    Pneumatologists, Atheists, Theists,—Plato, Aristotle,
                    Leucippus, Democritus, Pythagorus, Zoroaster and
                    Confucius. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2">It is the attitude of these men, more than

                    Between these and their commentators, it is true, there is
                    an endless dispute. But if it comes to this that you compare
                    notes, then you are all wrong. As it is, each takes
                    us up into the serene heavens, whither the smallest bubble
                    rises as surely as the largest, and paints earth and sky
                    for us. Any sincere thought is irresistible. The very
                    austerity of the Brahmans is tempting to the devotional
                    soul, as a more refined and nobler luxury. Wants so easily
                    and gracefully satisfied seem like a more refined pleasure.
                    Their conception of creation is peaceful as a dream.
                    "When that power awakes, then has this world its full
                    expansion; but when he slumbers with a tranquil spirit,
                    then the whole system fades away." In the very indistinctness
                    of the theogony a sublime truth is implied. It
                    hardly allows the reader to rest in any supreme first cause,
                    but directly it hints at a supremer still which created
                    the last, and the Creator is still behind increate.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Nor will we disturb the antiquity of the Scripture;
                    "From fire, from air, and from the sun," it was "milked
                    out." One might as well investigate the chronology of
                    light and heat. Let the sun shine. Menu understood
                    this matter best, when he said, "Those best know the
                    divisions of days and nights who understand that the day
                    of Brahma, which endures to the end of a thousand such
                    ages, [infinite ages, nevertheless, according to mortal
                    reckoning,] gives rise to virtuous exertions; and that his
                    night endures as long as his day." Indeed, the Mussulman
                    and Tartar dynasties are beyond all dating. Methinks
                    I have lived under them myself. In every man's
                    brain is the Sanscrit. The Vedas and the Angas are not
                    so ancient as serene contemplation. Why will we be
                    imposed on by antiquity? Is the babe young? When I
                    behold it, it seems more venerable than the oldest man;</p>
