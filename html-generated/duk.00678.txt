            (passing through the town of Borgo in old Finland, Russia,)
            Runeberg, the favorite poet of
                the Fin.—He is said to possess
                more than mediocre talent, and
                tunes his harp gracefully to
                granite, firs, and the rough music
                of the northern blasts—all of which
                the Finnish people love.
            Of Finland the roads are good,
                the scenery wild, pleasing landscapes,
                of which granite boulders, hills,
                lakes, and pine trees are the principal
                features—prevented from appearing
                monotonous by the endless variety
                of their arrangement.—The country
                is rough—the people are rough
                also—but friendly and strong.
