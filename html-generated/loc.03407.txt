                    a serious one, and

                    colonists were in great
                    jeopardy, many of their
                    boweries (farms) were
                    dest destroyed, and men

                    flee to Fort Amsterdam
                    for protection.—

                was maintained, giving an
                equal inheritance to all
                the children.
                1664 at this time Brooklyn
                was an ample collection
