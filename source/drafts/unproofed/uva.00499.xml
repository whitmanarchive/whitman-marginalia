                    trans. Francis G. Shaw (2 vols., New York, 1848). This novel was the sequel to
                    George Sand's <hi rend="italic">Consuelo</hi>, accounting in part for Whitman's
                    citation; his copies of both novels, held by the Library of Congress Rare Books
                    division, are now disbound, but the 1858 catalog of the New York Mercantile
                    Library (p. 37) lists the two novels bound together in its collection at the
                    time.</note>
