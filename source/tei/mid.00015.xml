        <p>There is one electric passage in
        this poetry, where the announcement
        is made of a great forthcoming
        Poet, and the illustration given of
        a king who, about dying, plunges
        his sword into his favorite attendant,
        to send him on before.&#8212;</p>
        <p>Alexander Smith is imbued
        with the nature of Tennyson. <del rend="overstrike">a
        good deal</del>.&#8212;He is full of what
        are called poetical images&#8212;full
        of conceits and likenesses;&#8212;in
        this respect copying after Shakespeare
        and the majority of the received
        poets.&#8212;He seems to be neither
        better or worse than the high
        average.&#8212;</p>
        <p><hi rend="underline">Bayard Taylor's poems</hi> more
            resemble N.P. Willis's than any
            others.&#8212;They are polished, oriental,
            sentimental, and have as attribute what
            <del rend="overstrike">so</del> may be called their psychology&#8212;
            you cannot see very plainly at times what
            they mean, although the poet evidently has a meaning</p>
