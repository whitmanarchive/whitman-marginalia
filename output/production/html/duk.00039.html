            in a good state of preservation, though they 
            appeared to have been for some time in the

            the quality of preserving whatever is cast 
            into it. Specimens of wood found there

        <p class="tei_p">We now quit with reluctance a subject in 
            which we feel very much interest. Lieutenant 
            Lynch's book must be pronounced of 
            great value, not only for the additions which 
            it makes to our knowledge, but as the authentic 
            record of an enterprise in the highest 
            degree honourable to all the parties concerned. 
            Our only regret is, that the author's 
            avowed anxiety to occupy the book-market has prevented him from digesting 
            his materials so carefully as the importance 
            of the subject demanded, and has left inexcusable 
            marks of haste, which should in any 
            future edition be removed. Mr. Bentley is 
            not, in this matter, altogether free from 
            blame; for there are numerous persons in 
            this country whose services would have removed 
            most of the grosser errors by which 
            the work is disfigured. As for the other 
            book, what we have already said, we say 
            once more:—It is a bushel of chaff, from 
            which those who think it worth their while, 
            and who have sufficient patience and skill, 
            may contrive to extract a few grains of 
            wheat.</p></div>

                element of History can be aware of the immense 
                importance of clearly keeping in view 
                the differences of race that are discernible 
                among the nations that inhabit different parts 
                of the world. In practical politics it is certainly<span class="tei_cb"/>
                 possible to push such ethnographical 
                considerations too far, as, for example, in 
                our own cant about Celt and Saxon, when 
                Ireland is under discussion; but in speculative

                past career and the future destinies of 
                nations, it is only by a firm and efficient handling 
                of this conception of our species as 
                broken up into so many groups or masses, 
                physiologically different to a certain extent,

                beings or their combinations, the historian 
                is able, in virtue of it, to announce one 
                important fact at the very outset,—to wit, that, <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_note_place_right tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_note_resp_h1 note"><span><span class="tei_span">? yes, of late</span><span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span><span class="tei_span">

                up to the present moment, the destinies of 
                the species <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h1">appear to have been carried 
                forward almost exclusively by its Caucasian 
                variety.</span> In the broad field and long duration 
                of Ethiopic or Negro life, only one native 
                and spontaneous civilisation appears to 
                have presented itself—that of the ancient 
                and almost mythical kingdom of Meröe on 
                the sources of the Nile. Mongolian humanity, 
                on the other hand, if we except the 
                two abortive beginnings of the native 
            Mexicans and Peruvians in America, has been
            able as yet to produce but one great 
            civilisation—that of the Chinese and Japanese. 
            With this Ethiopic retrogression, and this 
            Mongolian uniformity, compare Caucasian 
            progress, as exhibited in the splendid 
            succession of distinct civilisations, from the 
            ancient Egyptian to the recent Anglo-American, 
            to which the Caucasian part of the species 
            has given birth. Such, at least, is the Past; 
            as to the Future let no man speak!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">His attention thus specially directed to 
                the Caucasian section of mankind, the historian 
                finds it farther necessary to break it 
                also up into parts. Studying the physiological 
                and philological differences observable 
                within its field, he is able, in the first place, 
                to separate it into two great families of 
                nations, essentially distinct—the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Semitic</span> family, 
                consisting of men having the Arabic 
                physiognomy, and speaking a class of 
                languages, of which the Arabic is the type;</p>

            <span class="tei_cb"/>
            <p class="tei_p">and the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Indo-European</span> family, consisting of 
            men having a less determinable cast of 
            physiognomy, and speaking a class of languages, 
            of which the Sanscrit is the type. The 
            special geographical seat of the former, or 
            Semitic branch of the Caucasian stock, is 
            that part of Western Asia which lies 
            between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea 
            on the west, and the Tigris and Persian 
            Gulf on the east; these lands, together with 
            adjacent portions of Africa, are occupied by 
            Semitic peoples now, and have been 
            occupied by them from time immemorial. The 
            area over which the Indo-European branch 
            of the Caucasian stock has extended itself 
            is much larger, and the diversities of its 
            several partitions or offshoots are much more 
            marked and important. Schlosser, whose 
            scheme on this subject is the best that we 
            have seen, enumerates four leading 
            subdivisions of the Indo-European family:—
            1. The Armenian race, whose seat is in the 
            vicinity of the Caspian, and whose part in 
            history has hitherto been small; 2. The 
            Scythian race, overspreading the vast 
            regions of Eastern and North-Eastern 
            Europe, and of Central Asia, to the confines of 
            the Mongolian countries; 3. The Pelasgic 
            race, diffused, in the remotest ages, through 
            Asia Minor, the ægean Islands, Greece, 
            Italy, and other parts of Southern Europe; 
            and the mother-race of the great Greek and 
            Roman peoples; and 4. The Indo-Persic 
            race proper, stretching in Asia from the 
            Caspian to the Bay of Bengal; and the 
            parent, in the west, of the two great modern races, 
            the Celts of Gaul, Britain, Spain, &amp;c., and 
            the Germans of central Europe and the 
            Scandinavian peninsulas. All these races 
            scattered as they are geographically, and 
            differing, as they do from each other in 
            many important respects, are yet bound 
            together by certain similarities that distinguish 
            them in the mass from the Semitic branch 
            of nations.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mastering such current ethnographical 
            distinctions as these, the student of history 
            ought to take care at the same time thoroughly 
            to digest and appropriate the positive 
            notion that is wrapped up in them,—to wit, 
            that our species is not a huge collection of 
            perfectly similar human beings, but an aggregation 
            of a number of separate groups or 
            masses, the men of which, though all agreeing 
            in the grand characteristics of humanity, 
            all the creatures of a common Father, 
            and all the heirs of a common hope, have 
            yet such subordinate differences of organization 
            that, necessarily, they must understand 
            nature differently, and employ in life very 
            different modes of procedure. Assemble 
            together a Negro, a Mongol, a Shemite, an<span class="tei_cb"/>
            Armenian, a Scythian, a Pelasgian, a Celt, 
            and a German, and you will have before you 
            not mere illustrations of an arbitrary classification, 
            but positively distinct human beings, 
            men whose relations to the outer world 
            are by no means the same. In all, indeed, 
            there will be found the same fundamental 
            instincts and powers, the same obligation to 
            recognised truth, the same feeling for the 
            beautiful, the same abstract sense of justice, 
            the same necessity of reverence; in all, 
            the same liability to do wrong, knowing it 
            to be wrong. These things excepted, however, 
            what contrast, what variety! The 
            representative of one race is haughty and 
            eager to strike, that of another is meek and 
            patient of injury; one has the gift of slow 
            and continued perseverance, another can labour 
            only at intervals and violently; one is 
            full of mirth and humour, another walks as 
            if life were a pain; one is so faithful and 
            clear in perception, that what he sees to-day 
            he will report accurately a year hence; 
            through the head of another there perpetually 
            sings such a buzz of fiction that, even as 
            he looks, realities grow dim, and rocks, 
            trees, and hills reel before his poetic gaze. 
            Whether, with phrenologists, we call these 
            differences craniological; or whether, in the 
            spirit of a deeper physiology, we adjourn the 
            question by refusing to connect them with 
            aught less than the whole corporeal organism—bone, chest, limb, skin, muscle, and 
            nerve; they are, at all events, real and 
            substantial; and Englishmen will never conceive 
            the world as it is, will never be intellectually 
            its masters, until, realizing this as 
            a fact, they shall remember that it is perfectly 
            respectable to be an Assyrian, and 
            that an Italian is not necessarily a rogue 
            because he wears a moustache.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is but a change of expression to say 
            that races, whose individual specimens differ 
            so much, must stand in very different relations 
            to the general history of the world. 
            While the Shemite, for example, whose 
            mental characteristics are extreme spontaneity 
            and ease, attained his highest perfection 
            almost at once, and has since acted but 
            fitfully on the general condition of the world, 
            the Indo-European, on the other hand, with 
            faculties more stubborn and more dependent 
            on discipline, has advanced by successive 
            steps, and has charged himself specifically 
            with that part of the entire business of the 
            species which consists in continuous intellectual 
            evolution. Thus, in Europe, civilisation 
            as it now exists has been the progressive 
            work of three great Indo-European 
            races. First of all there was the Pelasgic 
            movement, including the whole of Greek 
            and Roman activity; to this succeeded the<span class="tei_cb"/></p>

                retained unchanged their native Slavonian 
                habits and characteristics. Even they, however, 
                were doomed at last to foreign invasion. Huns 
                and Avars had spared them, despising the 
                conquest of their sunless and wintry lands; 
                but the Northern Scaninavians, less difficult 
                to please, now began to pay them marauding 
                visits. At length, in the year 850,
                <span class="tei_span">one Danish or Swedish chief, named Rurik,

                of the Baltic, established himself at Novgorod, 
                and founded the dynasty of the Grand 
                Dukes of Muscovy, or Great Russia.</span></p></span>
            <p class="tei_p">The Muscovites or Great Russians, extending</span>
                 from the Baltic inland as far as the 
                Kwina and the Volga, and ruled over by a 
                Scandinavian dynasty; the Lekhs or Poles, 
                forming the two independent nations of 
                Lithuania and Poland proper, governed by 
                native dynasties, and extending from the Oder 
                to the Dnieper, and from the Baltic to the 
                Carpathian mountains; the Tchekhes or 
                Slavonians of the three independent states or 
                kingdoms of Bohemia, Moravia, and 
                Hungary; and the medley of Græco-Slavonian 
                nations, Croats, Servians, Bulgarians, 
                Slavonians proper, Dalmatians, &amp;c., attached to 
                the Greek Empire—such, in the ninth 
                century, were the four leading divisions of the 
                Slavonic family. A great change was produced 
                in the condition of these four Slavonian 
                masses individually, and in their 
                mutual relations, by the introduction among 
                them of Christianity. There were two 
                quarters, it is evident, from which Christianity 
                might reach the Slavonic nations—
                the Latin world on the west, spiritually 
                subject to the Roman pontiffs; or the Greek 
                world on the east, spiritually subject to the 
                patriarchs of Constantinople. From both 
                these quarters, Christianity did make its 
                way. The Lekha of Poland, and the 
                Tchekhes of Bohemia, Moravia, and 
                Hungary, received their religious forms chiefly 
                from the West, (<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">a.d.</span> 700-1000,) and 
                consequently became, for the most part, 
                adherents of the Latin or Roman Catholic 
                Church; the Græco-Slavonians, and the 
                Muscovites or Great Russians, on the other 
                hand, were converted chiefly by Greek 
                missionaries, (<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">a.d.</span> 640-1100,) and consequently 
                adopted, in preference, the rites and doctrines 
                of the Greek Church. This fact is of great 
                importance in its bearing on Slavonian 
                history. The Poles, the Lithuanians, and the 
                Tchekhes, for example, converted into adherents 
                of the Romish faith, became by that 
                <span class="tei_cb"/>
                very fact members of the great confederacy 
                of the Western nations; while the Russians, 
                the Bulgarians, &amp;c., fell back, as it were, 
                into the arms of the East. This distinction 
                was perpetuated by certain corresponding 
                differences in the written characters used by 
                the two groups of peoples. At first, the 
                Cyrillic alphabet, so called because it was 
                devised from the Greek by a Greek monk, 
                Cyril (873), was used, with the vernacular 
                form of service, even in Bohemia and Moravia, 
                where, indeed, Cyril preceded the Latin 
                missionaries: ultimately, however, by the 
                strenuous exertions of the Romish Church, 
                the Latin character and the Latin form of 
                service triumphed among all the Slavonian 
                Romanists, with the exception of some 
                Romanist communities among the Græco-Slavonians 
                of the Adriatic, for whom an 
                expressly new character was invented, 
                called the Glagolitic, and who were allowed, 
                besides, to retain their vernacular service. 
                The use of the Cyrillic character, therefore, 
                became a characteristic of the Slavonians of the Greek Church.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The two great influences between which, 
                as between two opposite pressures, we have 
                seen the Slavonian populations struggling 
                and gradually moulding themselves from 
                the fourth to the tenth century—to wit, the 
                encroachments of the German powers on the 
                west, and the indefatigable irruptions of the 
                Asiatic race from the east, did not yet cease 
                to operate. Let us briefly indicate the 
                results of their continued action from the 
                tenth century forward.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Roman Empire of the west, disintegrated 
                and overrun by the various Teutonic 
                races, had at length (800) been re-united 
                under the sceptre of the Fraukish Charlemagne. 
                But the purpose of this Germanic 
                reconstruction of the western world having 
                been fully served, a new subdivision was 
                required; and, in the year 843, the grandsons 
                of Charlemagne effected such a subdivision 
                by sharing among themselves the vast 
                dominions of their ancestor. Gaul and the 
                dominion of the western Franks were 
                assigned to Charles the Bald; Lothaire, the 
                eldest of the brothers, retained Italy and 
                other central territories, together with the 
                Imperial dignity; while Louis became master 
                of Germany, i.e., feudal chief of the 
                confederate German States proper, beyond 
                the Rhine.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The German Empire of Louis, in addition

                Bavaria, Saxony, Franconia, and Swabia,

               of Lithuania, and the Tchekhes of Bohemia. 
               Powerful from the first, and rendered still 
               more powerful by being converted (887) 
               from a hereditary possession of the Carlovingian 
               kings into a confederacy of free 
               States under an elective head, the German 
               Empire was able generally to extend its 
               Slavonian appendages. Under Henry the 
               Fowler, for example, who was Emperor 
               from 919 to 936, the districts of Brandenburg 
               and Lusatia were conquered from the 
               Lekhs and the Tchekhes; and by his successors 
               of the Saxon dynasty (936-1024) not 
               only were new conquests added to these, 
               extending the German frontier as far as the 
               Oder, but the Slavonian dukes of Bohemia 
               and Poland were reduced to the condition of 
               tributaries. The more thoroughly to Germanize 
               the Slavonian parts of the empire, 
               German colonies were planted and German 
               bishoprics established in them; and, indeed, 
               it was chiefly by the rough-handed efforts of 
               their German conquerors that the Northwestern 
               Slavonians were first reclaimed 
               from Paganism. To provide for the efficient 
               government of this quarter of the German 
               Empire, several margravates or 
               marquisates (literally earldoms of the marches) 
               were erected; of which the two most 
               important were the margravate of the North, 
               otherwise called the margravate of Brandenburg, 
               established on the frontier towards

               march,) established on the frontier towards 
               the Tchekhes of Bohemia and Hungary.</span></span> 
               This latter margravate, though but a creation 
               and outpost of the Germanic Empire, 
               soon swelled itself to the dimensions of a 
               great power, by assuming the chief burden 
               of the activity of the empire against the 
               Slavonians. Elevated into a Duchy by the 
               Emperor Frederic I. (1152) and still farther 
               aggrandized when Rudolph of Hapsburg, 
               having been elected to the empire in 1273, 
               assigned it as fief to his eldest son Albert, it 
               gradually acquired, by marriage, inheritance, 
               or conquest, (1273-1560,) dominion 
               over Bohemia, Moravia, Hungary, &amp;c., thus 
               absorbing into itself the whole of the Tchekh 
               portion of the Slavonian family. It was in 
               consequence of this "Very extension of its 
               rule by the annexation of Slavonian territories 
               that Austria attained that predominance 
               in the Germanic Empire which enabled it to 
               retain the imperial dignity, so long as that 
               dignity existed, in the possession of the 
               House of Hapsburg. Meanwhile, what the 
               margravate of Austria had been to the 
               Tchekhes or Southern Slavonians, the margravate<span class="tei_cb"/>
                of Brandenburg had proved to their 
               north-western brethren the Lekhs. Converted 
               into an Electorate of the empire by 
               the Golden Bull of Charles IV. in 1356, and 
               acquired by purchase in 1417 by the House 
               of Hohen-Zollern, this margravate was 
               gradually enlarged by the abilities of its 
               holders till it assumed the dimensions of 
               the original Prussian kingdom. That kingdom, 
               the creation of the successive Fredericks 
               and Frederick-Williams of the House 
               of Hohen-Zollern, is. in reality, but a well 
               Germanized section of the territories of the 
               Lekhs or central Slavonians. The name 
               Prussia itself was originally but the designation 
               of a Polish fief, added to the Electorate 
               in 1618; and it was not till 1701 that 
               the electors of Brandenburg, wishing a title 
               more descriptive of their possession as sovereigns 
               of a joint population of Germans 
               and Slavonians, assumed that of kings of 
               Prussia.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">While Germany was thus seizing the 
               Slavonian races from the West by its two 
               greedy arms, Prussia and Austria, a more 
               violent and stormy influence was agitating 
               them from the East. Since the days of the 
               Huns and the Avars, there had been a general 
               tendency of the Asiatic races to dash 
               themselves against the populations of Eastern 
               Europe. One such Asiatic race, calling 
               themselves the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Magyars</span>, and belonging not 
               to the Calmuck or Mongolian family, as 
               some have supposed, but to the Turkish or 
               Tatar subdivision of the great Caucasian 
               family, detached themselves about the year 
               880 from their Asiatic connexions, whatever 
               these were, and advancing into Europe, 
               under a chief named Arpad, took possession 
               of a large tract of land in the very heart of 
               the Tchekhes, and subjecting the native 
               inhabitants to serfdom, founded the present 
               Tatar-Slavonic kingdom of Hungary. The 
               name Hungary itself, though imagined by 
               some to have been an ancient name given 
               to that section of the Tchekh dominions, to 
               denote its previous extensive colonization by 
               the Huns or Kalmucks, is by others regarded 
               as a native Magyar appellation, given to 
               what had till then been known only as a 
               part of Great Moravia. In any case, the 
               Magyars were able almost instantly to naturalize 
               themselves in the fine country which 
               they had selected for their habitation. Under 
               Geysa, the grandson of Arpad, they embraced 
               Christianity, and thus entered within the 
               pale of Catholic Europe. Stephen, the son 
               of Geysa, assuming the title of King of 
               Hungary, became known as a warlike 
               potentate; and his successors following in his 
               footsteps, added the Græco-Slavonian territories 
               of Croatia (1100), Slavonia proper,</p>

            from without, that, instead of founding a 
            united Slavonic empire in Eastern, and 
            furnishing Slavonic dynasties to Western 
            Europe, they had fallen asunder into fragments, 
            some of which, like the German and Turkish 
            Slavonians, were but appendages to 
            foreign sovereignties, and others, like Russia 
            and Poland, but the Slavonian patrimonies 
            of foreign aristocratic houses. This singular 
            tenor of their past history did not by any 
            means demonstrate their incapacity to act a 
            wholesale part in the general career of the 
            human species, or the inferiority of the 
            Slavonic to other races. On the contrary, 
            as might more philosophically be argued, all 
            this sifting and tearing apart of the Slavonian 
            mass, and intermingling with it of 
            foreign ingredients, German, Turkish, Mogul, 
            and Magyar, had been but a necessary 
            process of preparation, in order that, finally, the 
            Slavonian genius might manifest itself with 
            greater power and acceptance, just as some 
            substances have their special and characteristic 
            attributes not altered or extinguished 
            by the limited interfusion of others, but only 
            developed and made available. Various 
            circumstances seem to indicate this, and to 
            prove that, at the present moment, there lies 
            underneath the uniform surface of Slavonian 
            Europe a pent-up flood of future influences.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In the first place, the various Slavonic 
            nations have all along taken a part in the 
            general commerce and material ongoings of 
            the world, such as only nations of good brain 
            and faculty could have been equal to. 
            They figure sufficiently well in McCulloch's 
            Commercial Dictionary, and in the lists and 
            figure-tables of Manchester manufacturers. 
            Russia, for example, with its marvellous 
            capital, St. Petersburg, containing nearly 
            500,000 inhabitants, exports wheat, flour, 
            cattle, furs, flax, oil, tallow, and hides, in 
            large quantities; imports foreign commodities 
            in return; and is altogether an important 
            member of the European confederacy of 
            nations. The Muscovite, or Great Russian 
            part of its population, are the fondest of trading, 
            and of industrial occupations generally; 
            the Cossacks, or Little Russians, are bolder, 
            less thrifty, and make better soldiers. Nor 
            are the Slavonian populations under German 
            rule inferior, after their respective fashions, 
            to the Russians. The Slavonians of Prussia 
            contribute their full share to the general 
            prosperity of that remarkable country. The<span class="tei_cb"/>
            kingdom of Bohemia, with its capital, Prague, 
            a town of about 110,000 inhabitants, is well 
            known to be one of the most important of the 
            manufacturing apartments of the Austrian 
            empire. Its glass has been celebrated since 
            the thirteenth century; its northern districts 
            are one continued manufactory of linens; 
            and its calicoes, woollens, china-ware, 
            cutlery, &amp;c., employ thousands of hands. From 
            the rich adjoining country of Moravia, the 
            capital of which is Brünn, a town of about 
            35,000 inhabitants, there is a large export 
            trade to various parts of Germany. 
            Hungary, whose commercial capital is Pesth, 
            with upwards of 62,000, and its political 
            capital, Presburg, with about 38,000 inhabitants, 
            is said to excel almost any country in 
            Europe in the abundance, variety, and value 
            of its natural productions. It has coal-mines, and mines of all the metals except 
            tin; it grows more wheat, maize, and oats, 
            than it can use; it has whole forests of fruit-trees; tobacco is cultivated in nearly every 
            part of it; it contains millions of sheep and 
            cattle of good breeds; and its wines, the best 
            of which is the sweet strong aromatic Tokay, 
            yield to none in the world. So richly 
            favoured by nature, the Hungarians do not 
            practise many branches of manufacture, but 
            import the manufactured goods they require 
            in exchange for their superfluous home-produce. 
            Nor is the prosperity of Hungary, 
            such as it is, the sole work of its ruling 
            inhabitants, the Magyars. The Slovacks of 
            its northern districts, a branch of the 
            Tchekhes of Moravia, are industrious cultivators 
            of their Carpathian valleys; besides 
            which, (whatever the fact may indicate,) a 
            detachment of them, after the manner of the 
            Italian organ-boys, are perpetually perambulating 
            Germany, with countenances and 
            eyes the most magnificent in the world, selling 
            mouse-traps. The kingdoms of Croatia 
            and Slavonia proper, too, politically incorporated 
            with that of Hungary, and enjoying 
            similar advantages of soil and climate, are 
            by no means nests of savages. Agram, the 
            capital of Croatia, a town of some 17,000 
            inhabitants, is a great market for the sale of 
            Hungarian wheat, tobacco, and pigs; and 
            the Croats, though rough fighting fellows, 
            dwelling in barns without windows, make 
            their own carts and ploughs, and drink their 
            own wine and plum juice. The Slavonians 
            proper resemble the Croats; their chief 
            town, Essek, is a handsome place, containing 
            about 12,000 inhabitants, and, besides trading 
            in grain, cattle, and hides, does a little 
            silk-spinning. The capital of lllyria, which 
            is the modern name of the patch of the 
            Slavonian territory lying between the Venetians 
            and the Croats, is the growing Austrian sea-</p>

                As regards the first, no more highly organized 
                language, we are told, was ever spoken 
                on earth than the Slavonic: vying in 
                grammatical devices as it is said to do with the 
                ancient Greek; possessing, for example, 
                numerous declensions, an ablative case, a 
                dual number, a patronymic termination, 
                diminutive and augmentative nouns, 
                frequentative and inceptive verbs, various 
                preterite and future tenses, inflexions of verbs 
                rendering pronouns unnecessary, unlimited 
                powers of compounding words, and a host 
                of serviceable particles; besides all which 
                it includes every articulate human sound 
                known, except the English </span><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><span class="tei_span">th</span></span><span class="tei_span">. Again, as 
                regards Slavonic literature; here, it is said, 
                with a due amount of all that varied intellectual 
                vigour that is exhibited in the literature 
                of the Indo-European races in general, 
                there is discernible a certain important 
                </span><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><span class="tei_span">differentia</span></span><span class="tei_span"> or originality, a certain peculiar 
                something that is not Celtic, that is not 
                Pelasgic, that is not Germanic, but solely and 
                essentially Slavonic. This peculiarity of 
                the Slavonic genius, this characteristic 
                attitude, if we may so call it, of the Slavonian 
                soul, naturally shows itself most clearly in 
                the higher poetry of the Slaves, and above 
                all, in their popular songs and ballads. </span></span>
                There, besides an intense nationality, and 
                a burning hatred, in particular, to the 
                Germanic races, partly produced, no doubt, by 
                historical causes, but arising to some extent 
                <span class="tei_span">also from the consciousness of a difference

                of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Revelations of Russia</span> to sum up for 
                us in this place, we should have from him, 
                in conclusion, a flat assertion of the general 
                intellectual superiority of the Slavonic to 
                the Teutonic races. Of this superiority, he 
                says, the Slaves themselves are profoundly 
                convinced. In the present state of our 
                information, however, it will be wise to say as little as 
                possible on that point.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There is still one other way in which the 
            worth of a people may be estimated; by 
            ascertaining, namely, whether they have, on 
            any occasion, fought and resisted bravely, 
            whether in their history there are any grand 
            and heroic passages, whether they have 
            ever stood forth before other men as the 
            champions of a cause. Tried by this test, 
            at least, the Slavonian peoples are safe. 
            Of their primeval heroism, of their conflicts 
            long and resolute with German, Turk, Mongol,<span class="tei_cb"/>
            and Magyar, we shall not speak; all 
            that is but mist and song. Coming down, 
            however, to a clearer day, what eye does 
            not rest fondly on one hour at least in the 
            European past, made memorable by 
            Slavonian courage—the hour of Huss, of 
            Jerome of Prague, and of Ziska, those three 
            Bohemian patriots, who, seized at a distance 
            by the spirit of the English Wycliffe, first 
            spoke the bold truth in their native part of 
            Europe, and scattered abroad, Slaves as 
            they were, seeds that were but revived by 
            the German Luther? Or, descending still 
            later, to our own times, who has not heard 
            of the brave struggle of the Servians against 
            the Turks, a struggle continued during 
            twenty-six years, (1804-30,) with a 
            determination comparable to that of the Scotch 
            under Wallace, and which resulted at last 
            in a guarantee of virtual independence 
            wrung by the subjects from their hard 
            masters? Nay, and if further proof should 
            be required, have we not one last argument 
            at hand in the history of the Polish nation?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">After remaining distinct for several 
            centuries, the two nations that had formed 
            themselves in the Tchekhish portion of the 
            general Slavonian area, to wit, Poland and 
            Lithuania, were united in 1385 by the 
            marriage of Hedvige, the Queen of Poland, with 
            Jagellon, the reigning prince of Lithuania. 
            The throne of Poland being elective, however,
            while that of Lithuania was hereditary, 
            the union was at first by no means 
            complete; and it was only in consequence 
            of a tacit suppression on the part of the 
            Polish nobles of their right to elect the 
            sovereigns of their country, that the princes of 
            the Jagellon line continued to rule in both 
            nations. To put an end to this anomalous 
            state of things, a formal arrangement was 
            made in 1569, by which the Lithuanian 
            sovereignty, becoming also elective, was 
            merged in that of Poland, the Lithuanian 
            nobles becoming entitled to all the 
            privileges enjoyed by their Polish brethren, that 
            of sitting and voting, for example, in the 
            general Diet; but the laws, the armies, and 
            the finances of the two countries to remain 
            still distinct. By this arrangement, Poland 
            attained the dimensions of a great European 
            state, extending from the Oder to and 
            beyond the Dnieper in one direction, and to 
            and beyond the Dwina in another. 
            Unfortunately, however, hardly had the union 
            taken place, when Sigismund Augustus, the 
            last of the Jagellon princes, died, (1572,) 
            and the throne, till then elective but in 
            theory, became elective in practice. From 
            that day dates the decline of Poland.

            <p class="tei_p">between different factions of the nobility, 
            of intrigues on the part of foreign states 
            interested in the success of different candidates, 
            and of religious persecutions directed 
            against the Protestant portion of the population. 
            Occasionally, indeed, as for example, 
            during the reign of the Hungarian Stephen 
            Battori, (1575-1586,) or during that of 
            John Sobieski, (1673-1690,) there was a 
            flash of new splendour; but on the whole, 
            the progress towards ruin was steady and 
            uniform. The reconstruction and enlargement 
            of the Muscovite kingdom under Ivan 
            the Terrible, (1550,) and the subsequent 
            accession to the Russian throne of the House 
            of Romanof, (1613,) were disastrous events 
            for Poland. Engaged in almost incessant 
            wars with Russia, as well as with Sweden 
            and Turkey, the Poles were reduced before 
            the middle of the eighteenth century to a 
            state of perfect helplessness. Even before 
            the close of the seventeenth, they had lost 
            part of their territories by ceding, on the 
            west, the Lithuanian fief of Prussia to the 
            Electorate of Brandenburg, to which it had 
            till then belonged only dependency; and 
            on the east, various Cossack districts on the 
            Dnieper to Russia and Turkey. Their farther 
            humiliation, however, if not their total 
            annihilation as a nation, was the fixed 
            scheme of the House of Romanof. Peter 
            the Great, (1689-1725,) founding the Russian 
            Empire by his genius, had chalked out 
            for his successors a line of policy, leading, 
            by implication, to the subjugation of Poland. 
            It was reserved for Catherine the Great, 
            (1762-1796,) to execute the project. The 
            Polish throne becoming vacant in 1764, she 
            sent a Russian army to compel the Diet to 
            elect her former lover, Stanislaus Poniatowski. 
            The Czartoryskis, then the heads 
            of a zealous Reform party in Poland, 
            supported the nominee of the Empress, hoping 
            the best results from her avowed liberalism. 
            No sooner was Poniatowski elected, 
            however, than Russian influence was employed 
            to crush the Reforms proposed by the Czartoryskis. 
            A civil war followed; Russian 
            armies occupied the country; and in 1772, 
            took place, under Russian auspices, the first 
            dismemberment of Poland. By this 
            dismemberment, the Poles lost 3925 square 
            German miles of their territories, or more 
            than a fourth part of the whole. The confiscated 
            lands were divided unequally 
            between Prussia, Austria, and Russia; Prussia 
            receiving the most valuable portions of Western 
            Poland proper and Western Lithuania; 
            Austria, the territories that now constitute 
            the kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria; 
            and Russia nearly the whole of her present<span class="tei_cb"/>
            provinces of Livonia, Witepsk, Mochilew, 
            and Minsk. Thus diminished and degraded, 
            Poland endeavoured to regenerate wbat was 
            left of her. Again Russia remorselessly 
            interfered, and by a second dismemberment, 
            (1792,) the Poles were deprived of 5614 
            square German miles of their territories, 
            1061 of which were appropriated by Prussia, 
            and 4553 by Russia. Then ensued the 
            last struggle under Kosciusko; on the 
            suppression of which, (1795,) the third 
            dismemberment took place; and Poland was 
            effaced from the map of Europe.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">"And rightly served!" cry our stern 
            judges of the worth of nations. "A 
            wrangling pack of some 200,000 nobles, with 
            millions of serfs under them, uneducated and 
            ill-fed: such was the Polish nation—a 
            nation that deserved to die, if ever nation did!" 
            Quick reasoning; very summary justice! 
            Was Poland, under the Jagellons, in a worse 
            condition than other countries in Europe? 
            Even in her worst days, were her serfs more 
            degraded beings than those of Russia now? 
            Did not Poland, even in her later days, 
            accomplish some things that were great—
            produce a Copernicus; give birth to a Sobieski? 
            Was her crime of a bad constitution one 
            unparalleled in the history of nations that have 
            turned out well? Has the change been for 
            the better? Have her spoilers, Austria, 
            Prussia, and Russia, been more conscientious 
            stewards of the interests of the Polish 
            millions than those whom they superseded? 
            Was there no evidence that a change was 
            in progress in Poland herself at the very 
            hour when her life was trampled out? A 
            Poland organized by Kosciusko and 
            Niemcewicz, what had it been in Europe now! 
            Those struggles, too, of the Poles to regain 
            themselves, those services under Napoleon, 
            and insurrections under Nicholas that have 
            scattered the Slavonic physiognomy over the 
            earth, and filled our cities with men the types 
            of energy—are they of no account? Above 
            all, was the punishment a doom, or only a 
            probation? Is there no pardon? has there 
            been no repentance? Has not Poland, 
            territorially defunct, waxed morally stronger? 
            Has not the sore trial of eighty years 
            fulfilled its stated purpose; and if now, the 
            chastened, united, Polish spirit were gathered 
            as a thunderbolt, and let loose on Slavonic 
            Europe, would it not split and nobly 
            recreate it?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The following is a survey of the present
            arrangement of the Slavonic race, as quoted

            <p class="tei_p">Perczel, Damianich, Guyon, men of all nations,
            Magyars, Slavonians, Englishmen. On
            Bem, the brave Pole, saved from the fate of
            Blum by a difficult escape from Vienna, was
            immediately conferred a high command. 
            Such were the visible signs of preparation;
            of the invisible and unknown reality who
            shall speak—of the thoughts, prayers, and
            fears of ten millions of human beings, as fit
            for liberty as the people of England, and
            spread over a country twice as large?
            Worthless, indeed, the heart that, beating
            freely in this land of ours, franchised for us
            by the blood of our fathers, can think 
            unmoved of those millions of our contemporaries
            striving to do the like for their children, albeit
            they do live in Eastern Europe, and call
            themselves Magyars!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In December, 1848, the war was begun. 
            An Imperial army of 130,000 men under 
            Windischgrätz as commander-in-chief, and 
            Jellachich and other generals of note as his 
            subordinates, entered Hungary. The movements 
            of the various divisions of this army, 
            and the countermovements of the Hungarians, 
            during the four months that followed, 
            will some day form a subject of study for 
            such as shall be interested in military science. 
            At present the details are hardly 
            known. Suffice it to say that, during these 
            four months, the Hungarians beat their enemies 
            again and again ; beat them in slight 
            engagements, and in pitched battles; beat 
            them in bravery and in strategy; beat them 
            at the very time when the Austrian journals 
            were publishing lying reports of victories 
            gained by the Imperialists, and when hardly 
            a true account from beleaguered Hungary 
            could reach the rest of Europe. All that 
            title to freedom, therefore, that arises from 
            lion-like courage, from fierce hard obstinacy, 
            from perfect soundness of head joined to 
                <span class="tei_span">
                strength of heart, </span><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline"><span class="tei_span">from unwearied and successful perseverance in a course once begun</span></span><span class="tei_span">—a title more respected by the world in general, and by Englishmen in particular, than 
            any arising from mere historic or metaphysic</span></span>
            right—this the Hungarians showed themselves 
            most unmistakably to possess. In one 
            other respect, too, they proved the superior 
            temper of their race. Fighting against generals 
            the most pitiless and barbaric that 
            ever took the field, men that, defeated in battle, 
            would hang, shoot, burn, flog, and call it 
            military firmness, the Hungarians carried all 
            gently, heroically, like a people noble in misfortune. 
            That such a people should win 
            would be a boon to the world. Nor, had they 
            been left, they and their natural enemies, to 
            fight it out equally between them, could the result 
            have been doubtful. One more trial, 
            however, was to be heaped upon them. Already,<span class="tei_cb"/>
            in April, 1849, had the Austrians been 
            driven from Hungary; already in the same 
            month had the emancipated Hungarians proclaimed 
            their freedom, and chosen Kossuth 
            their first chief and President, with other ministers, 
            both Magyar and Slavonian, to assist 
            him, when the flood-gates of northern despotism 
            were opened on Austrian solicitation, and 
            the expected tide rushed in. In the end of 
            April 50,000 Russians crossed the Hungarian 
            frontier. Other armies have followed in 
            their track. And now for three months
            has the war been waging between the 
            Hungarians and the united Russian and Austrian
            armies. The efforts of the Hungarians have 
            been unprecedented; like brave men, they 
            have staked all on their last struggle. In 
            their first battles they beat the Russians, as 
            they had already beaten the Austrians; at 
            the moment that we write, however, matters 
            wear a more perplexed aspect, and all 
            Europe waits with anxiety to know the issue. 
            Should the Hungarians finally be victorious, 
            the results will be most beneficial; in Eastern 
            Europe there will be founded a free 
            Magyar-Slavonic State, stronger and greater than 
            Austria, a splendid commercial member of the 
            European commonwealth, and a nucleus, 
            round which the Slavonic races may gradually 
            and conveniently form themselve according 
            to their common Panslavic or their separate 
            national tendencies : should the Russians, on 
            the other hand, win the day, then there will 
            be Panslavic Empire in right earnest; the 
            Tsar, overruling decrepit Austria like a master, 
            will place his foot upon Constantinople, 
            and look scowlingly towards the European 
            West, and this state of things will continue 
            till the coming blow shall be struck that 
            shall shiver Russia itself in pieces, and 
            proclaim a new era for the enfranchised world.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">T</span> has been lately shown that there is poetry 
            in science, and more recently it has been 
            asserted that there is poetry even in railways. 
            We cheerfully adopt both these 
            propositions in all their truth and beauty, and 
            are surprised only at the limitation with 
            which the sentiment had been surrounded. 
            Poetry acknowledges no boundary to its domains. 
            Its strains are breathed throughout 
            the physical as well as the moral world—its 
            music is heard among the spheres—it chaunts 
            its lays over the loves of the plants, and its 
            sympathies are entwined even round the 
            sufferings and enjoyments of irrational 
            existence. What a noble epic is the universe 
            itself! delineated in radiant hieroglyphics on 
            the azure canvass of the firmament, as 
            explored by the space-penetrating tube of the 
            astronomer, and decyphered by the analysis 
            of the mathematical sage. What a 
            melodrame is exhibited on our own globe, while 
            it speeds in ether its annual and its daily 
            round;—on our earth-home—the stage upon 
            which man has so long strutted his brief 
            hour, emblazoning his vices and his crimes, 
            and rioting in giddy frivolity above burning 
            caverns and primeval tombs, and among the 
            contemporary dead, over whom he has 
            himself sighed and wept.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Beneath the lava crust on which he daily 
            treads and slumbers, he witnesses the tragedy 
            of the pre-Adamite age, in which all the 
            characters have perished, without leaving a 
            seed behind;—while on its surface is played 
            the comedy of modern life, in which intellectual 
            and immortal man eats, and drinks, and 
            dies; and exhibited the farce, in which kings 
            and conquerors are reproduced in clay, or 
            embalmed by the apothecary, or thrust under 
            ground by the sexton. Nor is the poetry of 
            life thus limited to humanity with its 
            conflicting interests and passions. It claims 
            a right of song over the speechless denizens<span class="tei_cb"/>
            of the forest and the heath, of the ocean and 
            the air. The Pierian spring has tributaries 
            even in the haunts of ferocious natures; and 
            with the blood-stained hearth of the tiger, 
            and the roofless home which the jungle or 
            the rock affords to the carnivorous pilgrim, 
            there are associations of tenderness and love, 
            of suffering and enjoyment, more noble and 
            affecting than those which are linked with 
            the lower and more savage grades of 
            humanity. When animal and intellectual life 
            are sheltered under the same roof, and when 
            instinct and reason are auxiliaries in the 
            house or on the heath, we learn to appreciate 
            the virtues and the affections, if not the 
            knowledge and the wisdom, of the brutes 
            that perish.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The poetry of mechanism is one of the 
            most interesting departments of the poetry of 
            science, and that of railways cannot fail to 
            be regarded as the Iliad of its productions—
            embracing the account of works the most 
            expensive and gigantic—the description of 
            engines the most ingenious and complex, and 
            the history of social ameliorations which are 
            now altering the very condition of man—
            virtually extending the very term of his 
            existence, and opening new and extensive fields 
            for the exercise of his holiest and noblest 
            affections.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is not our design in the following 
            Article to amuse the reader with any account of 
            those singularly curious and interesting 
            arrangements* which have been rendered 
            necessary by the great and rapid extension 
            of the railway system, for the comfort and 
            security of the millions whom it accommodates. 
            Our object is to give the general 
            reader some idea of the origin, progress, and 
            extent of the railway system—of the ingenious 
            inventions and stupendous works which 
            it has called into existence—of the social 
            triumphs which it has achieved—of the 
            improvements of which it is susceptible, and 
            which are necessary for the security of life 
            and property—of its present state and prospects 
            as a commercial speculation, and of 
            the necessity of protecting it as a great 
            national institution,—by the development of 
            the whole traffic of the empire—by the grant 
            of public aid—by placing all the railways 
            in the kingdom under the management of 
            Government, and by preventing in 
            future that enormous expenditure of railway 
            capital which has been so unnecessarily 
            sunk in the preliminary stages of their 
            existence, and which has led to the ruin of 
            many of those enterprising capitalists to</p>
