                certainty are&#8212;that he was born at Hierapolis
                in Phrygia; that he became (how is unknown)
                slave to Epaphroditus, a freedman and favourite
                of Nero; that while in his master's service he
                attended the philosophic lectures<ref target="#fn2">2</ref> of a Stoic,
                C. Musonius Rufus; that he somehow obtained
                his freedom, and was banished from
                Rome about the year 90 A.D., when the tyrant
                Domitian, by a public edict, 'cleared Rome of
                what most shamed him,' the teachers of philosophy;

            <p>these things I endeavoured to set down in his very
                words, that having written them I might preserve
                to myself for future times a memorial of his thought
                and unstudied speech. Naturally, therefore, they
                are such things as one man might say to another
                on the impulse of the moment, not such as he would
                write in the idea of finding readers long afterwards.
                Such they are, and I know not how, without my will
                or knowledge, they fell among men. [There seems
                to have been a 'pirated' edition of Arrian's private
                memorials brought out, which he would have been
                unwilling to let appear, could he have helped it, in
                their crude state.] But to me it matters little if I
                <span rend="singleLine-left" hand="#h6" xml:id="s1" from="#s1" to="#s2"/>shall appear an incompetent writer, and to Epictetus
                not at all, if anyone shall despise his words.
                For when he was speaking them it was evident that
                he had only one aim&#8212;to stir the minds of his
                hearers towards the best things.<anchor xml:id="s2"/> And if, indeed, the
                words here written should do this, then they will
                do, I think, that which the words of philosophers
                ought to do. But if not, let those who read them
                know this, that when he himself spoke them
                it was impossible for the hearer to avoid feeling whatever
                Epictetus desired he should feel. And if his words,
                when they are merely words, have not this effect,
                <fw type="catch" place="bottom right">perhaps</fw>
                <pb xml:id="leaf006r" facs="loc.03452.006.jpg" type="recto"/>
                perhaps it is that I am in fault, perhaps it could not
                have been otherwise.</p>
            <p>The style of the <hi rend="italic">Discourses</hi> answers very
                well to the above account of their origin and
                purpose. They are brightly and vividly written,
                containing passages of great interest, but are,
                as a whole, wanting in unity and coherent
                development. Moreover, there is a great deal
                of this unsystematic record of Epictetus' daily
                conversation. The eight books must have made
                up a volume sufficiently bulky and expensive
                to prevent the slave-philosopher from being
                very widely read among the class for whom
                his teaching was intended. And it is particularly
                important to notice that it was by no
                means intended for aristocratic amateurs in
                Stoicism, but for men subject every day to the
                stress of life,<ref xml:id="ref3">1</ref> workers, to whom a philosopher

                must speak clearly and briefly if he would have
                a chance of being listened to. It seems likely,
                then, that it was considerations such as these
                which induced Arrian to put together the leading
                principles of his master's teaching in that
                inestimable little work known as the <hi rend="italic">Encheiridion</hi>,
                or Handbook, of Epictetus.</p>
            <p>The result has shown how wisely Arrian
                judged of the means necessary to make Epictetus'
                influence widely felt, and to give him a
                permanent hold upon the human mind. For

                least, by the proveable reality of the facts which
                it declares and on which it builds. If these
                facts, in the case of Stoicism, are, as many
                seem to think, mere philosophic fancies, incapable

            let me devote a few pages towards offering a
                mere suggestion of its basis and drift, as they
                appear to me.</p>
            <span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h6" xml:id="s7" from="#s7" to="#s8"/><p>In the first place it must be understood that
                Epictetus is not a philosopher in the sense in
                which that word is generally used now. About
                the origins and destinies of things he is strictly
                silent, no shadow of an explanation of any
                metaphysical problem is to be found in him.
                The end of his teaching is simply to take the
                sting from human misery by showing that
                man is not, as was believed, the plaything
                of Fortune&#8212;that there is a way in which he
                can set his well-being beyond the reach of all
                forces which he cannot control. <span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h4" xml:id="s9" from="#s9" to="#s8"/><span rend="singleLine-left" hand="#h4" xml:id="s10" from="#s10" to="#s8"/>Stoicism, as
                represented by Epictetus, makes no attempt
                to transcend the limits of what can be actually
                felt, now and here. It rests upon a profound
                appreciation of the distinction between what
                we may call a man's real and permanent, and
                his transitory or phantasmal self.<anchor xml:id="s8"/> The first
                man who was ever consciously a Stoic (there

                have been and are many unconscious ones)
                was he who first looked upon the world and
                his own nature, and observed that the things
                wherein he was subject to fatality and chance,
                which he was unable to order at his own will,
                were just those which either did not affect
                <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, his real self, at all; or affected him only
                as he desired they should. The question,
                then, about Stoicism, is this, Is this distinction
                between the real and phantasmal self a valid
                one&#8212;is it founded upon natural truth? Now,
                let no friend of the Association philosophy
                imagine that in this 'real self' of Epictetus he
                is being confronted with his ancient enemy, the
                Ego. To say that <hi rend="underline" hand="#h3">there is a real self</hi> and that
                <hi rend="underline" hand="#h3">there is a phantasmal self</hi> need imply no more
                than this&#8212;that among all the things which give
                pleasure there are some which afford a deeper,
                fuller, more permanent enjoyment than others;
                an enjoyment of such a kind that he who has
                felt it knows it to be more worth having than
                anything else in the world. The real self,

            <fw type="pageNum" place="top right">xvii</fw>
                then, is simply the soul delighting in these
                things, and to pursue them is said to be, in
                <span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h4" xml:id="s11" from="#s11" to="#s12"/>the words of the old, yet never outworn formula,
                <hi rend="underline" hand="#h3">'to live according to Nature'</hi>&#8212;to follow<anchor xml:id="s12"/>
                the course suggested to the conscious mind by
                experience (its own or others') of the facts of
                life. And what does this experience tell us?
                Universally it tells us that in Righteousness
                and Love lie the paths of our peace. That
                this is so every man must verify for himself.
                'The gods' with Epictetus are the sources of
                this law, and, so far as explicit statement goes,
                they are little more.</p>
            <p>Now, keeping this notion of the real self
                before us, let us turn to Epictetus and see
                how he applies it. 'Of things that exist,' he
                says, 'some depend upon ourselves (&#941;&#900;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#965; &#941;&#981;&#900;
                &#951;&#900;&#956;&#953;<!--Can't find the accent that goes above this last character.-->&#965;), others do not depend upon ourselves.'
                That is to say, some things centre upon the
                <span rend="singleLine-left" hand="#h3" xml:id="s13" from="#s13" to="#s14"/><span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h3" xml:id="s300" from="#s300" to="#s14"/>real self, are within its domain and power,
                and have their existence through it; while<anchor xml:id="s14"/>
                others are independent of it, are outside the
            <fw type="sig" place="bottom">a 2</fw>
                <fw type="catch" place="bottom right">sphere</fw>
            <pb xml:id="leaf009v" facs="loc.03452.012.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <fw type="pageNum" place="top left">xviii</fw>
            <fw type="header" place="top right" rend="italic">PREFACE.</fw>
                sphere of its action, as it is outside the sphere
                of theirs. What, then, are the former things?
                'Opinions and impulses, desires and aversions'
                &#8212;briefly, that which a man <hi rend="italic">does</hi> as opposed to
                that which he suffers. 'And these things,' he
                adds, 'are, in their nature, free, not liable
                to forbiddance or embarrassment.' So that
                Epictetus starts with announcing that the
                business and concern of the real self is with
                matters absolutely subject to its own control,
                absolutely uninfluenced by external chance or
                change. How important this announcement
                is will only appear by meditation and realisation:
                that it is true there can be no doubt&#8212;
                <span rend="singleLine-left" hand="#h4" xml:id="s15" from="#s15" to="#s16"/>there is nothing essentially good for us which
                we cannot have if we only desire it strongly

                <p>Again, in <hi rend="italic">Ench.</hi> i. &#949; he teaches that when

                power to close the sources of true happiness,
                the happiness which satisfies the real self,

            <span rend="doubleLine-left" hand="#h5" xml:id="s19" from="#s19" to="#s20"/><p>And, again, in <hi rend="italic">Ench.</hi> xliv., one man is

            <p>Such ideas as these seem, when their
                bearing on practice is first realized, so profoundly
                discrepant with human life as it is,
                that most people are inclined to regard them,
                though not without admiration, as being merely
                unpractical and fantastic. But, apart from
                the fact that this discrepancy is probably far
                less great than is generally supposed (many
                persons, especially in great crises, showing
                themselves true Stoics who might be incapable
                of reading a chapter of Epictetus with sympathy),
                it must be remembered that what I</p>
                <fw type="catch" place="bottom right">have</fw>
            <pb xml:id="leaf011r" facs="loc.03452.014.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <fw type="pageNum" place="top right">xxi</fw>
            <p>the <hi rend="italic">Encheiridion</hi> might present itself as unpractical,
                to others it might seem to be quite
                sufficiently practised already. For Stoicism is
                often taken to be merely a synonym for intellectual
                self-sufficiency and heartlessness, for
                scorn of human affection and an ascetic disregard
                of at any rate the material welfare of
                others as well as of oneself. It is no answer to
                this accusation to point out passages in Epictetus
                (such as <hi rend="italic">Ench.</hi> xxx. xxxii. xliii.; <hi rend="italic">Frag.</hi> ii. xvii.),
                which are full of a quite different spirit; they
                would only prove that the philosopher may
                have been better than his creed. <span rend="singleLine-right" hand="#h6" xml:id="s23" from="#s23" to="#s24"/>But the
                creed itself is a more profound and a more
                expansive one than is commonly supposed;
                for, its fundamental principle being merely to
                place Good and Ill in the things dependent
                on the will, <hi rend="underline" hand="#h6">it leaves room for any doctrine
                as to right living which can establish itself
                upon this basis.</hi><anchor xml:id="s24"/> Thus it leaves room for asceticism,
                or for indifferentism; and many Stoics
                were, as a matter of fact, ascetics or indifferentists.

                    it may often be necessary for us to
                    sacrifice a gratification to a duty, while to
                    sacrifice a duty to a gratification is quite
                    another matter. For to do the duty at the
                    expense of the gratification leaves, so far, our
                    capacity for the gratification just where it was;
                    while to indulge a gratification at the expense
                    of a duty undoubtedly injures our capacity
