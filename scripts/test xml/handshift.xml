            <p>For the truth is, that the creations of the 
                    human mind transcend its capacity to collect 
                    and preserve them; and, like the seeds 
                    of life in the vegetable world, the intellectual 
                    powers of man are so prolific that 
                    they run to waste. Some readers, perhaps, 
                    as a bright company of splendid names 
                    rushes on their recollection, may be disposed 
                    to say 'avaunt' to these melancholy 
                    forebodings. <handShift new="#h2"/>(<handShift new="#h1"/><hi rend="underline" resp="#h2">Surely, it</hi> can be only necessary

                    shall endure: even to translate is to 
                    injure them. Thus it is, that for one reader 
                    of Archimedes (even amongst those who 
                    know just what Archimedes achieved,) there

                    Newton it may be truly said, that nine-
                    tenths of those who are familiar with his 
                    doctrines have never studied him, except at 
                    second-hand. Far more intimate, no doubt, 
                    is that sympathy which and 
                    Milton inspire; <hi rend="underline" hand="#h3">"being dead they yet speak,"

                of Newton, what must be naturally and universally
                the fate of inferior men? Of that

                foundation of analytical geometry, how few

            <p>It may be said, perhaps, that if in so vast
                a majority of cases the hope of immortality
                is a dream, 
                and serene old age have always been
                thought desirable things, rather than a
                sudden and violent dissolution. Immortality
                is not to be thought of—but <hi rend="italic">euthanasia</hi> <add rend="insertion" place="bottom"><handShift new="#h2"/>"euthanasia"
