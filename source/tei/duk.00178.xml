                            has a large number of enthusiastic admirers in Germany,
                            Great Britain, and the United States. The following sketch,
                            by one of his own countrymen, presents his private character
                            in no very favorable light:</p><!--The following quotation appears to be from "Titan. Perthes the Publisher, and Literary Germany." 1857, James Hogg Titan?-->
                            <p>"We are far from being idolators of Goethe. We consider
                            the excessive worship of him by Carlyle and Lewis as,
                            in the first, a mental, and in the second, a moral derangement.
                            Goethe, as a man, we not only dislike, but loathe.
                            He had all the faults supposed to be incident to the genial
                            temperment, without that temperment itself. Byron
                            even seems respectable compared to him. Byron was the
                            slave of passion; Goethe sinned on system. Byron was
                            the creature of impulse, Goethe came calm, if not sober,
                            to the perpetration of seduction, and the patronage of suicide.
                            Byron never seduced a female, Goethe many. Byron
                            drank to drown remorse, and to stop despondency on
                            the edge of despair and madness; Goethe to intensify pleasure
                            and to nourish pride. Sin soured Byron; it agreed
                            with Goethe's constitution, and he continued healthy and
                            almost happy with it. Sin was driving Byron latterly towards
                            Christianity; it drove Goethe to a belief in an immoral
                            and lifeless God. Byron shrank, withered, and died,
                            on the poisons he had imbibed; Goethe fattened, flourished,
                            and became an octogenarian on their strength.
                            Byron sinned like an erring man; Goethe like a pagan god
                            whose wickednesses seem all the more intolerable that
                            they are done with a high hand, from a celestial vantage-<lb/>
                            ground, without any human-like result of remorse. Both
                            become satirists; but, while the satire of Byron&#8212;in its
                            very bitterness as well as fire&#8212;proves that the iron has
                            entered into his soul, that of Goethe is cool, sardonic, and
                            seems to mock not only the object of its scorn, but that
                            scorn itself. The one, at the worst, is the smile of a Satan
                            &#8212;a being of hot heart, disappointed ambition, and awful
                            regrets; the other we may liken to Ahrimanes himself, the
                            fabled aboriginal evil god, who may sneer at, but can hardly
                            be angry at, the evil he has himself made, and which
                            has always seemed to him good.</p>
                            <p>With these views of Goethe's character we, of course,
                                warmly admire his genius. He united qualities seemingly
                                the most incompatible; Horatian elegance with almost
                                <choice><orig>Shaksperean</orig><reg>Shakespearean</reg></choice> imagination; unbounded command over the
                                regions of the ethereal, with the coolest intellect, and stores
                                of worldly wisdom worthy of Lord Bacon. "No writer,"
                                Emerson said once, "has less nonsense in his works than
                                Goethe." No writer, at all events, has turned his <choice><sic>nonsonse</sic><corr>nonsense</corr></choice>
                                to better account, or handled his filth with a more
                                delicate touch. Some of his looser writings remind you
                                of&#8212;<lb/>
                                "Garden gods, and not so decent either;"
                                but they are formed with all the elegance of Canova's
                                sculpture. The story of the "Elective Affinities" is one of
                                intertangled abomination almost incredible; the characters
                                resemble a knot of foul toads, but few indecorous expressions
                                occur. Many of the scenes are exquisitely beautiful.
                                Sentiment of a pure and lofty kind alternate with essential
                                "smut," and close to the fire-springs of guilty passion lie
                                masses of clear, icy, but true and deep reflection. "The
                                Sorrows of <choice><orig>Werter</orig><reg>Werther</reg></choice>" seems to us a wondrously trashy production,
                                and, were it appearing now, would be classed with
                                inferior French novels. It would now fail in producing a
                                single suicide. Altogether, Goethe's works give us the impression
                                of extreme coldness, and not of the cheerful,
                                bracing cold of snow, but of the deadly cold of the grave,
                                if not rather of that cold which Milton has ventured to represent
                                in the very heart of Pandemonium, where "frozen
                                Alps" nod to "fiery," and where alike fire and frost are
                                everlasting. Intellect and imagination, without heart, principle,
                                or geniality, although with considerable power of
                                simulating sympathy with all three, were, in spite of Lewis,
                                the true constituents of Goethe's genius; and Walsingham,
                                in Sterling's "Onyx Ring," is his perfect likeness.</p>
