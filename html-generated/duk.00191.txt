            Torquato
            Tasso
            15544—1595—(51 years)
            Born at Sorrento, near Naples.
            Father a poet, and educated gentleman
            (Bernardo Tasso.)
            Mother died at his 16th or 17th year.—
            Torquato studied—moved among the
            nobility, the courts, the learned, &amp;c
            Wrote the poem "Rinaldo" in his 18th year
            —in 10 months.—rec'dreceived through Italy
            with great applause.
            At the age of 21, went to Ferrara,
            as a gentleman inof the household
            of the Cardinal d'Este.
            The two ladies, "the Princesses," sisters of
            the Cardinal d'Este, Lecretia, aged 31
            Leonora, 30.  soon married to Prince D'Urbino—With these "Tassino" was
            a favorite.—
            (The father Bernardo died 1569, aged 76
            "after a life marked by many vicissitudes
            and sorrows, but cheered throughout by a
            literary enjoyment, and a truly Christian
            philosophy.—")
            In 1570 Tasso "attended his lord the
            Cardinal to the Court of France."
            DTasso made application some time
            after to be received into the service
            of Alphonso, Duk d'Urbino, Lucretia's husband and succeeded.
            —He was assigned a pension of 1500
            crowns of gold a month.—
            
            
            TasoTasso 2
            He soon after worked faithfully and
            at leisure on the "Jerusalem."
            But first finished and published his
            pastoral poem of "Aminta"—rec'dreceived thro'through
            Italy with great applause.—
            Completed the Jerusalem in 1575 (ag 31)
            —He submitted this poem to the
            judgment of a number of his friends—
            —"a step which in the sequel
            involved him in the greatest difficulties,
            not less from the diversity of opinions
            than from the ascetic severity of some
            of his censors, who professed to see,
            in his charming fictions, something
            profane and seductive," &amp;c &amp;c
            The "Jerusalem" underwent several
            revisions, two grand ones, in
            particular—one of the censors read it not 
            as a critic, but as an "inquisator"
            (Jealousies, absurd criticisms, heart sickness,
            &amp;c. &amp;c)
            Tasso goes to Rome.— But soon
            returns to Ferrara.)
            Has "an interview with one of the
            Duke's greatest enemies.")
            (Italian suspicion and treachery—fears,
            doubts, and cross‑purposes.)
            Several troubled years—the Jerusalem
            printed
            Tasso had not long returned from Ferrara,
            ere his melancholy, induced originally on his
            ardent temperament by the severity of his critics,
            and the persecutions of his enemies, returned upon
            him more deeply than ever.—
            
            
            Tasso 3
            He had "symptoms of that mental disorder
            which was soon to affect his reason."
            He disturbed himself with hundreds of
            fantastic fears.—
            "At length one evening in June 1577
            (ag 33) in the chamber of the Duchess
            d'Urbino he ran after one of her servants
            with a drawn dagger."
            The Duke now issued orders to have
            Tasso confined in his chamber.
            (More fears, groundless alarms, dread of
            losing the favor of the Duke.)
            Tasso takes flight clandestinely
            from Ferrara, leaving his MSS. &amp;c
            From this period a wanderer from
            Court to Court in Italy, a prey
            to sorrow and morbid heart.
            Goes to Sorrento, to his sister—Goes
            to Rome—at last returns,
                to Ferrara, under a cool per‑
            missionpermission from the Duke
            But leaves Ferrara again soon
                —wanders—wanders—wanders—
            at last bringing up again at
            Ferrara—during a marriage festi‑
                valfestival of the court—is neglected—
            —in a fit of invective gives loose
            to the keenest invectives against the
            House of Este—The Duke is app‑
            prizedapprised of them, and Tasso, and Tasso
            is arrested and taken to the hospital of
            St. Anne, an asylum for lunatics &amp; paupers.

            This was in 1579—years passed—
            sick, declining, sometimes sane,
            sometimes crazed—over sev
            over seven years passed
            in this prison—he
            was liberated in 1586—
            —Again, he travels up and
            down Italy—
            
            The last twenty years of
            his life seem to have passed
            very unhappily, wandering, insane,
            (just conscious enough of it,
            to make it doubly poignant),
            —either persecuted, or, which
            is always worse, supposing himself to
            be persecuted.—
            Personally, Tasso was of lofty
            stature, fair complexion, (event‑
            uallyeventually pale,) head large, beard
            brown, eyes large, (their look
            generally directed toward the heavens.)
            —of attractive appearance—
            born a gentleman in an age when the term had all its high distinction.
