                Passages noted from Schlegel have been identified as coming from Joseph Gostwick's German Literature, which was published in 1854 (Walt Whitman: Notebooks and Unpublished Manuscripts, ed. Edward F. Grier [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 5:1837).

            Frederick Schlegel
            1772-1829 1
            (57) one of
            two
            celebrated
            literary
            brothers
            —the other named
            Augustus
            
            Had a strong predilection
            toward the wonderful and mysterious—
            1803, entered Roman Catholic Church.—
            
            Wrote "Philosophy of History,"—most
            valuable idea tenet of which is,—"the
            inexpediency of destroying old institutions
            before new ideas are prepared
            to developedevelop themselves in consistency
            with the order of society.—"
            —Lectures "(History of Literature" 1811–12)
            have chiefly extended his fame
            —He makes Literature the repre‑
            sentativerepresentative expression of all
            that is superior in a nation—
            thus elevating it, especially
            poetry, far above the views of
            trivial and commonplace criticism,
            and regarding it as incorporating
            and being the highest product
            of human life and genius
            —He appreciates the great masters of
            all countries, and sets them off from
            crowds of temporary persons
            
            Prejudices—But remember in
                ☞reading these Lectures, that Schlegel
            was full of the Prejudices of a
            zealous newly converted Roman Catholic.—
