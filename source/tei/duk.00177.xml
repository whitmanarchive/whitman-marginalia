            <ab>In person Spenser was small
            and delicate, and in costume
            precise, "as became a man of taste."</ab>
            <ab>His face had sweetness &amp; refinement
            —mild almond‑shaped eyes,—forehead
            lofty, but not very wide—was

            <ab>Tone of Spenser's poetry is unworldly,
            abstracted, contemplative in the
            highest degree—loving high themes—
            princeliness, purity, white garments,
            —rather averse to reality—his
            personages being only half‑real—
            —He is haunted by a morbid refinement
            of beauty—beauty three times washed
            and strained—</ab>
            <milestone unit="unknown" rend="horbar-short-left"/>
            <ab>No doubt but he was very learned.—</ab>

            <ab>Even at the time of writing them, Spenser's
            words, in his poems, were many of
            them unusual, obsolete, or considered
            affected and strained.</ab>
