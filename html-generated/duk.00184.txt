                Goethe's Complete works, last complete edition
                    of his own revision, 1827–8, a short time
                    before his death.—Goethe born 1750—died 1832
                Carlyle, in reviews and otherwise, seems to have
                    I  been the introducer of Goethe and the
                    principal German writers, from 1827 onward 10 years
                Goethe—(reading Carlyle's criticisms on
                    Goethe.) over
                    leaf
                Here is now, (January 1856) my
                    opinion of Goethe: Had I not better read more of
                    Goethe, before giving an "opinion"?
                He is the most profound reviewer of
                    Life known.—To him life, things, the
                    mind, death, people, are all studies,
                    dissections, exhibitions.—These departments
                    he enters upon in modes not comparable
                    with any previous excellence, but with
                    unequalled grandeur and coolness and depth of pen‑
                    etrationpenetration.—In the work of As a critic he
                    stands apart from all men, and criticisescriticizes
                    them.—He is the first great critic,
                    and the fountain of modern criticism.—
                Yet Goethe will never be dear
                to men well beloved of his fellows..— Perhaps he knows too much.
                    I can fancy him not being dear to well beloved of
                    Nature for the same reason.—A
                    calm and mighty person whose anatomical
                    considerations of the body are not
                    enclosed by superior considerations, makes
                    the perfect surgeon and operator upon
                    the body upon all occasions.—So Goethe
                    operates well upon the world....his office
                    is great....what indeed is greater?—He shall
                    have the respect and admiration of the whole.—
                    There is however what he cannot have from
            
                Goethe—1750—1832
            
            His first literary productions fell in
            his 23d year
            Sorrows of WerterWerther in his 25th year
            in 1776—Goethe was seen by the heir‑apparent
            of Weimar
            Soon after invited to court—and accordingly
            settled at Weimar
            (Goethe was tall, handsome, every way
            personally attractive)
            had the title of Legations‑rath.—
            (some time after) By degrees whatever was brightest
            in Germany had been gathered to this
            little court.
            There was a classical theatretheater under Goethe
            and Schiller 
            There Wieland taught and sang.
            In the pulpit, there, Herder.? was this
                a about 1807
            Goethe had risen until at last he was
            appointed Minister (I suppose Chief)
            
            ☞So Goethe lived amid princely persons,
                all ceremonies, etiquetsetiquettes, ranks, ribbons,
                caste, the classics, refinements, taxes,
                money plenty, deference,—all that belongs
                to a petty German court, with and the
                minutest observances of the same,
                with exact precedence and routine for
                every thing.—arranged art exhibitions,
                palace‑building, laws for the university
                and so on.
            
            Goethe 1750—1832 2
            Goethe's poems, competitive with the
                antique, are so because he has
                studied the antique.—They appear
                to me as great as the antique
                in all respects except one.—
                That is, the antique poems
                were growths—they were never studied
                their from antiques.—
            Goethe's Wanderjahre wvandryahré was published in
                his 72'd year.—Sorrows of
            WerterWerther
            in his
            25thIt'sIts characters
                illustrate, (in dialogue and incident)
                a philosophical theory of the
                Christian religion, finely spun.
                —The orthodox statements of
                Christ, the crucifixion, &amp;c are
                re‑statedrestated—"the sun hiding its
                head when He died,"—&amp;c
            
            Feb. 18 '56—There is one point of the
                Goethean philosophy which at once without appeal  and forever
                    incapacitates it from suiting America or
                    the forthcoming years.;—It is that the
                    cardinal Goethean doctrine too, that the artist
                    or poet is to live in art anor poetry alone
                    apart from affairs, politics, facts, vulgar
                    life, persons, and things—seeking his "high ideal."
            
            Feb. 22. Goethe is never carried away by his
                theme—he is always master.—He is the head
                person saying to a pupil, Here, see how well this can be done.
            
            Goethe
            Carlyle vaunts him as having  showing that
                a man can live even these days as "an antique worthy."—
                This vaunt Goethe deserved—he is indeed
                a cultivated German aristocrat,
                physically inextricable from his age and position,
                but morally bent to the Attic spirit
                and its occasions two thousand and
                more years ago;—That is his he;
                and such are his productions.—
                All tThe assumption that Goethe
                passed through the first stage
                of darkness and complaint, to
                the second stage of consideration
                and knowledge.—and thence to the
                third stage of triumph and
                faith—this assumption, in the
                cannot pass, and remain permanently cannot stand
                amid the accepted judgments of the
                soul.—He Goethe's was the faith
                of a physical well‑being,—a good digestion and appetite—it
                was not the faith of phro the masters, poets,
                prophets, divine persons.—Of sSuch
                faith he perhaps came near, and
                saw the artistical beauty of,—perhaps
                fancied he had it—but he never
                had it—
