                The paste-on attached to the back of this leaf is part of "Poems of Ossian," by James Macpherson, in Fourth Reader: For Common Schools and Academies, ed. Henry Mandeville (D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1851), 255. Whitman also references September of 1856 and "early in '57" in his notes, suggesting that his annotations are from the mid to late 1850s.

                                other civil and military dignitaries. JASMIN
                                recited some new verses of his composition, and
                                terminated an address of thanks by making an

                            1 O THOU that rollest above, round as the shield of my fathers!
                                whence are thy beams, O Sun! thy everlasting light?
                            2 Thou comest forth in thy awful beauty, and the stars hide
                            themselves in the sky: the moon, cold and pale, sinks in the
                                3 western wave. But thou thyself movest alone: who can be
                            4 a companion of thy course? The oaks of the mountains
                            fall´; the mountains themselves decay with years´; the ocean
                            shrinks and grows again´; the moon herself is lost in heaven´;
                            but thou art forever the same, rejoicing in the brightness of
                                thy course.
                            5 When the world is dark with tempests´; when thunders
                                roll and lightnings fly´; thou lookest in thy beauty from the
                            6 clouds, and laughest at the storm. But to Ossian, thou
                            lookest in vain; for he beholds thy beams no more; whether
                            thy yellow hair floats on the eastern clouds, or thou tremblest
                                7 at the gates of the west. But thou art, perhaps, like me,
                            8 for a season; and thy years will have an end. Thou shalt
                            sleep in thy clouds, careless of the voice of the morning.
                            9 Exult, then, O Sun, in the strength of thy youth! Age
                                10 is dark and unlovely: it is like the glimmering light of the
                                moon, when it shines through broken clouds, and the 
                                on the hills: the blast of the north is on the plain: the
                                travellertraveler shrinks in the midst of his journey.
