                The printed text on the paste-on is a translation from Cicero's "de natura deorum" that originates in Edward Everett's widely reprinted lecture commemorating the inauguration of the Dudley Observatory, delivered at Albany on August 28, 1856. The lecture was reprinted in the November 1856 issue of The Eclectic Magazine as "The Utilities of Astronomy" (Volume 39), pp. 374–392. The whole item is pasted down, making the verso unavailable.

            A whole poem

            going forth, seeing all the beautiful
                perfect things—
                
            
                
                    
                        
                            
                "Nobly does ARISTOTLE observe, that if there were
                beings who had always lived under ground, in convenient,
                nay, in magnificent dwellings, adorned with
                statues and pictures, and everything which belongs
                to prosperous life—but who had never come above
                ground,—who had heard, however, by fame and report,
                of the being and power of the gods,—if at a
                certain time, the portals of the earth being thrown
                open, they had been able to emerge from those hidden
                abodes to the regions inhabited by us; when
                suddenly they had seen the earth, the seas, and the
                sky; had perceived the vastness of the clouds and
                the force of the winds; had contemplated the sun,
                his magnitude and his beauty, and still more his
                effectual power, that it is he who makes the day by
                the diffusion of his light through the whole sky;
                and when night had darkened the earth, should
                then behold the whole heavens studded and
                adorned with stars, and the various lights of the
                waxing and waning moon, the risings and the settings
                of all these heavenly bodies, and the courses
                fixed and immutable in all eternity; when, I say,
                they should see these things, truly they would believe
                that there were gods, and these, so great
                things, are their works."
