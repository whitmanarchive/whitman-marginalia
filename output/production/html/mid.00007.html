                attending literary men, which generally
                makes all straight in the end;</span> the old
                axiom of "Extremes meet" seems to govern
                this rule, and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2">in proportion as an author is
                    abased by some, he is lauded by others,
                    not only personally but poetically.</span> There are,
                of course, the usual exceptions,—some one
                way, as Walter Scott,—some the other, as in
                the case of Southey; but action and reaction
                is a principle of nature.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We doubt if there ever were a writer so
                fiercely vilified as the author of "Wat
                Tyler," who had so little of the pleasanter
                side of praise administered to him in his
                lifetime, notwithstanding his influence and
                position. There has not even been the
                usual re-action when the grave has consecrated
                his virtues, and obliterated his failings;
                indeed, so far as we may be allowed
                to judge from present appearances, he seems
                already shrinking into the very narrow compass
                of his "Life of Nelson," and the poem
                he repudiated, "Wat Tyler!" That posterity
                may reverse this decision is possible, although,
                taking the past as a guide, not probable.
                The two causes which deprived him
                of enthusiastic eulogizers during his life, will
                operate, we think, even more conclusively as
                the circle expands, and deposit him on the
                bleak shore of respectability, leaving him
                farther removed from human sympathy as
                the tide of time recedes.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The causes we allude to are, his want of
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2">high or distinctive genius, and moral geniality.
                    In the greatest imaginations these are
                    generally found together, as in Homer, Ariosto,
                    Shakspeare, and Cervantes.</span> Some cases,
                <span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">however, exist in which they are separated,
                as in Dante and Milton; but possibly in
                both these latter instances political and domestic
                sorrows, as well as the severe temper
                of the times, </span><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2 tei_hi_xml:id_u1"><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">may have had a modifying, if

            <p class="tei_p">That Southey was altogether deficient in
                that logical and creative phrenzy (if we may
                like Willis or Emerson coin on our own account)
                which <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">our</span> great Anglo-Saxon poet
                calls "a fine phrenzy"—(we advisedly say <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">our</span>,
                for Shakspeare as much belongs to the American
                people as he does to the English, seeing
                that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">our</span> ancestors claimed him as a fellow-citizen)
                —that Southey was deficient in this
                godlike faculty is evident to any who has
                read all or even any of his voluminous
                poems; that he was destitute of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">bonhomie</span>
                was as equally apparent to a casual acquaintance,
                or an old friend.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">He had no impulse. In a word, we may
                define him as the Genius of Routine; that
                was the only </span><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">genius</span></span><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight"> he possessed. In saying
                this let our readers clearly understand
                that we neither undervalue nor disparage
                Southey, or the regularity of which he was
                so striking an example; </span><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2"><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">we merely define

                    means no insult to a triangle when he says
                    it is not a circle.</span></span><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight"> Indeed, to borrow a geometrical
                term, Southey was eminently an
                angular mind: he did not incorporate in his
                own nature the knowledge he was constantly
                acquiring; he merely added it to what he
                already had. </span><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2"><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">Knowledge made Southey
                    learned, it made </span><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">Shakspeare</span><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight"> wise; it enabled
                    the one to alter and illustrate, the other to
                    create and beautify; it enriched the </span><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">nature</span></span><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">
                    of the one, but only the recollection of the
                    other. Knowledge made the author of Hamlet
                    philosophical and imaginative; it rendered
                    the writer of Thalaba prolix and
                    fanciful; it was a telescope and a microscope
                    to </span><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">Shakspeare</span><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">, a mere pair of colored spectacles
                    to Southey.</span></span> We repeat, that in selecting
                    the greatest of poets for this parallel,
                    we have no wish to depreciate, but simply
                    to take the highest of each class, in order
                    to render the contrast more striking.</p>

            of Holy Writ, as illustrated by the parable of
            the talents. We shall not even condemn
            him for his remarkable change of opinion
            in religion and politics: for this also he
            had the precedence of a sacred example
            in St. Paul so far as the right of search
            and change is concerned; but he had no
            authority for his malignant persecution of
            those who continued to hold the same
            opinions as he had once entertained. Surely,
            this ought to have counselled charity; but
            <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2">it is a singular proof of human blindness,
            that men never hate themselves for their
            former heresies!</span> Let us, therefore, set an
            example of charity ourselves, and suggest
            that it is merely the opinions they hate,

            <p class="tei_p">We remember Sergeant Talfourd used this
            <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">argumentum ad hominem</span> with great effect
            on a trial for rioting at Gloucester. Baron
            Gurney, a very able but severe judge, who
            presided, had been, during the French Revolution,
            one of the Jacobin Club in London
            notorious for its anarchical principles.
            This was well known to Talfourd, who defended
            the rebels, and who was so irritated at
            the judge's undue leaning against the prisoners,
            that in the defence he begged "his
            lordship would reflect if in his own experience
            he did not remember any one who
            had formerly been an ardent admirer and
            correspondent of Robespierre and Marat;
            one who was also a member of a club, whose
            toasts were such as, 'The heart of a king
            grilled on the ribs of his minister;' and
            whether he was not now one of the most
            distinguished ornaments of the bench; and
            what would have been his fate had no time
            been given to him to repent, and repay the
            society he had outraged," &amp;c. This had so
            great an effect, that in his charge the conscience-struck 
            Gurney directed the jury to
            acquit them, with only a severe reprimand.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">Men should bear in mind that uniformity
                of opinion would soon become a dead level of
                intellect. Indeed, what diversity of scenery
                is to the picturesque, variety of mind is to
                the intellectual world.</span> If all men thought
                alike, human nature would soon become a

            <p class="tei_p">We have thought it necessary to make
                these preliminary remarks in order that our
                readers may the better comprehend our
                view of Southey, and his aspect of society.
                It will however be advisable to glance
                hastily at his intimates and contemporaries
                before we fairly enter upon his own particular
                life and correspondence. These were
                undoubtedly some of the most remarkable
                men the world of genius has produced; we
                shall however confine ourselves to those
                most immediately acting upon his conduct
                and opinions.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Coleridge, Lloyd, and Lovell were those
                who were his first intellectual associates;
                after a time, Wordsworth, Lamb, and Cottle
                were added. All these were men of a peculiar
                stamp, some of the highest powers. The
                greatest was undoubtedly Coleridge, not
                only for his attainments, imagination, and
                enthusiasm, but also on account of the eloquence
                with which he advocated any system
                he adopted; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_hi_hand_h2">even his inconsistency gave
                    a poetical charm to his conduct!</span> Ever
                the slave of impulse, but preserved from
                vice by one of the most gorgeous, and, at
                the same time, subtle imaginations vouchsafed
                to a human being, the author of
                Christabel was at once a giant and a child.
                While his comprehensive and logical mind
                detected at a glance the most plausible
                sophism of another, he was constantly bewildered
                in those of his own creation; his
                silken clue inevitably failed him in the
                labyrinth of his own planning; he was
                no Daniel in the den of his own lions!
                Coleridge was to himself throughout his life,
                what the Spectre was to the hero of one of
                Calderon's plays, the name of which we forget:
                he always found <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">himself</span> opposed and
                overthrown by <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">himself</span>. Like a silk-worm he
                lived in a world of his own spinning, and
                which was destined eventually to be his

                    Christ School Boy." He never outgrew his
                    gigantic boyhood. Fresh from the trammels
                    of school, he longed to plant idylls and
                    eclogues on the banks of the Susquehanna,
                    of which he was to be one of the piping
                    Corydons, with some young Phillis fond of
                    throwing love-apples at him, and listening to
                    his strains, and always giving the award in
                    his favor. A variety of causes combined
                    gave a similar tendency to the more practical
                    mind of Southey. But a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fortunate</span> want
                    of money saved them from this egregious
                    folly; for there never were two men less
                    fitted for emigration to a new world than
                    they were.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Love, poverty, a vague aspiration for
                    liberty, and a restlessness, which Southey
                    finally conquered, were the motives which
                    led him to entertain the Pantisocratic scheme.
                    It is a mistake to suppose Wordsworth
                    ever for an instant was mixed up in this
                    Utopian dream; indeed, the bare suspicion
                    annoyed him so much, that on the publication
                    of Chorley's "Authors of England" in
                    1842, the old poet requested the writer of
                    this article to beg Mr. Chorley would correct
                    the mistake he had made in his life of
                    Coleridge, where Wordsworth figures as
                    one of the emigrant party.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">The head and front of this "Empire Plan"
                    was really Lovell; but a practical view of the
                    whole question dissipated the chimera.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Both Lloyd and Lovell were singular
                    beings. The former was evidently tinged
                    with insanity even at that early period;
                    towards his middle age it showed itself so
                    unmistakably that he was placed in a Lunatic
                    Asylum, where he spent most of his remaining
                    years; he was eventually killed in endeavoring
                    to escape from one in France, no
                    many years ago. <span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">In addition to being a
                    lunatic, he was also a poet, and he had the</span>
                    honor of helping Coleridge and Southey to
                    fill up their first volume of poems published
                    at Bristol by their friend Cottle. <span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">Insanity
                    and poetry are hereditary in Lloyd's family,
                    for his eldest son, who is a scholar, a Christian,
                    a man of fortune, and an elegant poet,</span>
                    has been for some years under partial
                    restraint. We know him well, and have
                    heard from him the statements we have just
                    made, and confirmed by others.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Lovell was Coleridge and Southey's brother-
                in-law, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">three</span> having married the
            <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">three</span> Misses Fricker. Strange enough that<span class="tei_cb"/>
            insanity should also develop itself in these
            ladies. Edith, Mrs. Southey, died insane
            after lingering in that state some years, and
            Mrs. Coleridge has acted so strangely through
            all her life as to cause considerable apprehension
            in her friends' minds for the ultimate
            result.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Wordsworth's influence on Southey was
            small, notwithstanding the respect which he
            entertained for the great philosophical poet.
            This partly arose from their not coming
            together at Southey's plastic age; for like
            hot lava, Southey hardened very soon. This
            is curiously developed in the correspondence
            now before us; he seems at once to spring
            from Pantisocracy to common sense, in the
            commonest acceptation of the term. By-the-
            bye, while we think of it, we may ask the
            accomplished and conscientious editor why
            he has omitted a letter from his father to Coleridge
            respecting the latter's disinclination to
            marry Miss Sarah Fricker? It was written in
            reply to one from Coleridge, "in which he
            stated very weighty reasons why he should not
            marry just then, but leaving it to Southey to
            decide whether he thought he was bound in
            honor to fulfil his engagement <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">immediately</span>."
            Southey's answer was lengthy and decisive,
            and determined Coleridge at once to marry,
            among difficulties amply illustrated in Cottle's
            "Recollections," and from which we
            question if he ever thoroughly emerged. The
            Gillmans, of Highgate, have a copy of this
            interesting epistle. It would throw a little
            light upon the state of Coleridge's heart,
            which might perhaps clear up the darkness
            which now apparently hangs over his long
            separation from his "besonneted Sara!"</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is only due to the departed poet's
                memory to remember that his children,
            Hartley, Derwent, and Sara, were to the last
            most affectionately attached to their father,
            at the same time not forgetting their duty to
            their mother. This is a volume in Coleridge's
            favor more conclusive than any he has written
            himself; for no such three children,
            perhaps, ever came together, either for intellect,
            conscientiousness, or rectitude.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">After this little sketching, let us introduce
            the hero of the present drama.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Southey thus records his own birth:—
            "My birthday was Friday, 12th August,
            1774; the time, half-past eight in the
            morning, according to the family Bible.
            According to my astrological friend Gilbert,
            it was a few minutes before the half hour,</p>

            <span class="tei_fw tei_fw_type_header tei_fw_place_top tei_fw_rend_italic">Robert Southey.</span>

            <p class="tei_p">pleasure. Moore has very happily expressed
                this retrospection:</p>
                <span class="tei_lg tei_lg_type_linegroup"><span class="tei_l">"Sighing, as o'er the shadowy past,</span>
                <span class="tei_l">Like a tomb-searcher, Memory ran</span>
                <span class="tei_l">Lifting the shroud that Time had cast</span>
                <span class="tei_l">O'er buried hopes."</span></span>
            <p class="tei_p">We now and then come upon pithy
                axioms, such as—(Southey is talking of his
                schoolmaster): "When his ill circumstances
                pressed upon him, he gave way perhaps
                more readily to impulses of anger; because
                anger, like drunkenness, suspends the sense
                of care, and an irascible emotion is felt as a
                relief from painful thoughts." This is however
                only half the case: anger is an excitement,
                and consequently suspends the duller sense
                of care, or any other equable state of mind;
                but Southey forgets, or perhaps never knew,
                that the real cause of the phenomenon is the
                weakness of mind, resulting from the irritation
                of the mosquito bites of buzzing animals,
                who very properly sting sleeping debtors till
                they wake and pay.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">We have however, a few passages further
                    on, a proof of how little a learned man is a
                    wise-one. "He would strike with a ruler
                    sometimes when his patience was greatly
                    provoked by that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">incorrigible stupidity</span>
                    which of all things, perhaps, puts patience
                    to the severest trial."</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Let us tell our readers that of the three,
                    the blockhead, the master, and the apologist,
                    the most incorrigible fools are the
                    schoolmaster for striking, and the Laureate
                    for defending the blow. Mr. Southey's joke,
                    too, about punishing a creole, is a proof of
                    his want of humor. We will not quote
                    the joke, having no wish "to throw a damp
                    upon a funeral."</p>
                <p class="tei_p">We have, however, a most serious charge
                    against the author of Kehama, and one of
                    his own convicting: we quote verbatim his
                    very words:—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">"One of them (evidently by his name of French
                extraction) was, however, the most thoroughly
                fiendish human being that I have ever known.
                There is an image in Kehama, drawn from my
                recollection of the devilish malignity which used
                sometimes to glow in his dark eyes, though I
                could not there give the likeness in its whole force,
                for his countenance used to darken with the blackness
                of his passion. Happily for the slaves on the
                family estate, he, though a second brother, was
                wealthy enough to settle in England; and an anecdote
                which I heard of him when he was about
                thirty years of age, will show that I have not
                <span class="tei_cb"/>
                spoken of his character too strongly. When he
                was shooting one day, his dog committed some
                fault. He would have shot him for this upon the
                spot, if his companion had not turned his gun aside,
                and, as he supposed, succeeded in appeasing him;
                but, when the sport was over, to the horror of
                that companion, (who related the story to me,) he
                took up a large stone and knocked out tbu dog's
                brains. I have mentioned this wretch, who might
                otherwise have better been forgotten, for a charitable
                reason; because I verily believe that his
                wickedness was truly an original, innate, constitutional
                sin, and just as much a family disease as
                gout or scrofula. I think so, because be had a
                nephew who was placed as a pupil with King, the
                surgeon at Clifton, and in whom at first sight, I
                recognized a physiognomy which I hope can be
                long to no other breed. His nephew answered in
                all respects to the relationship, and to the character
                which nature had written in every lineament of
                his face. He ran a short career of knavery, profligacy,
                and crimes, which led him into a prison,
                and there he died by his own hand."</p>
                <p class="tei_p">The commonest observer must remark the
                    tender difference with which he treats the
                    reputation of a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">living</span> rich man, to the dead
                    memory of the poor dependent. Farther on
                    we have another phase of character: our
                    space, however, will not allow us to quote;
                    we must therefore content ourselves by requesting
                    our reader's attention to Southey's
                    account of his interview with an old schoolfellow,
                    whom he designates under the initials
                    H. O. They will find it at the close
                    of chapter xii. We question if a more singular
                    confession of feeling was ever before
                    so ingenuously given to the world.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">There are many <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">naÏve</span> admissions in his
                    autobiography, which, for a man of the
                    Laureate's caution, strike us as remarkable.
                    <span class="tei_span tei_span_highlight">In some very pertinent remarks on poetry he
                    observes: "In the earliest ages, certain it is
                    that they who possessed that gift of speech
                    which enabled them to clothe ready thoughts
                    in measured or elevated language, were
                    held to be inspired.</span> False oracles were delivered
                    in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">verse</span>, and true prophecies delivered

                    passed for magic in the dark ages, sleight
                    of tongue for inspiration." We can well
                    imagine how such a heretical or dangerous
                    opinion in the writings of another would
                    have drawn down his anathema as a "Quarterly

            <span class="tei_cb"/><p class="tei_p">in health, and full of renewed plans, taking
                up their residence at Bristol.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Towards the close of this year he obtained,
                    through Mr. Wynn's untiring friendship,
                    the appointment of private secretary to Mr.
                    Corry, Chancellor of the Exchequer for Ireland,
                    at a salary of £400 per annum. He
                    was however only required a short time in
                    Dublin; on his return he was steadily settled
                    at London as Mr. Corry's secretary. In
                    the meantime he had published "Thalaba,"
                    the copyright of which he sold for £115.
                    In January, 1802, his mother died: this
                    was a heavy blow, as Robert Southey was a
                    man full of domestic feelings.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Finding his office to be a sinecure, he,
                    with an honesty which ought to be more
                    generally followed, resigned his secretaryship,
                    and resolved to settle in the country.
                    After casting "his eyes" about him, he fixed
                    upon the Lakes of Westmoreland, to which
                    his friend Coleridge had already retired. In
                    September, 1803, immediately after the death
                    of his only child, a little girl of scarcely a
                    year old, they settled at Greta Hall. He had
                    already made the acquaintance of the Longmans,
                    and received several commissions from
                    them, which afterwards led to a connection,
                    closed only by the Laureate's death. Southey
                    had now reached his thirtieth year, and had
                    settled down in a spot from which he never
                    after removed, to devote his energies to a
                    purely literary life: perhaps we have no
                    other instance of a man so completely following
                    up that one idea without reference to
                    anything else, as the distinguished man
                    whose life we are reviewing.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">His industry was the most untiring of
                    any author's of modern times. In March,
                    1804, he thus wrote to his friend John
                    Rickman:—"I have more in hand than
                    Bonaparte, or Marquis Wellesley—digesting
                    Gothic Law; gleaning moral history from<span class="tei_cb"/>
                    monkish Legends; conquering India, or
                    rather Asia, with Albuquerque; filling up
                    the chinks of the day by hunting in Jesuit
                    Chronicles, and compiling Collectanea Hispanica
                    et Gothica. Meantime Madoc sleeps,
                    and my lucre of-gain-compilation (specimens
                    of English Poets) goes on at night, when
                    I am fairly obliged to lay history aside, because
                    it perplexes me in my dreams. 'Tis a
                    vile thing to be pestered in sleep with all
                    the books in the day I have been reading
                    jostled together!"</p>
                <p class="tei_p">In the May of 1804 he visited London, and
                    met some new society. He however was
                    not a very "clubbable fellow," as Johnson
                    would phrase it. He was soon at his home
                    at Keswick again, in the midst of his books,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">He had now made considerable headway
                    in his History of Brazil, and looked forward
                    to another sojourn in Portugal to finish it.
                    Coleridge had been now for some time at
                    Malta, as secretary to Sir Alexander Ball,
                    and Southey's letters to him are full of
                    hints, which afterwards ripened into works—
                    Coleridge had always great theories to propound,
                    and was a most suggestive companion
                    and correspondent, as Southey and
                    Wordsworth often acknowledged.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">We pause at this point of the Laureate's
                    life to call the reader's attention, not alone to
                    the singular change in his political and religious
                    opinions, but also in his habits of
                    daily life. From the wild enthusiast he becomes
                    tamed town to the orthodox disciplinarian;
                    from the dreamer of Pantisocracy he
                    suddenly awakes to the realities of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">L.s.d.</span>-ism;
                    from the Lesbian heights of Pindarics' epics,
                    and Sapphics, he leaps into the level sea of
                    Routine!</p>
                <p class="tei_p">But we must reserve the moral we have
                    to deduce from this singular harlequinade 
                    to our next number.</p>

                    a ploughman originally, he rose to high poetical
                    fame. He has been called the greatest
                    untaught genius since Shakspeare. His poems
                    glow with the real fire of feeling and passion.
                    As soon as he appeared in print he was
                    noticed and drawn from the plough to associate
                    with men of letters and opulence. But
                    the change ruined him. He indulged in licentious
                    pleasures, till his constitution gave
                    way, and the tomb received him. He died at
                    the age of 39.</p>
