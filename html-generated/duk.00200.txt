            The native name of Egypt is
            Khami, (black,)
            
            The Semitic and Iranian families are
                primitively connected with each
                other. ? (Are they not the same?)

                which applies equally to

            In Egypt and in Assyria, and
                doubtless in other ancient languages lan nations,
                there were separate castes in
                language, as in men—there was
                one written language for religion, one perhaps for
                the nobility, and without doubt one for the common
                mass of people.
            
            
            resume—(from Bunsen)
            —Thus there in Assyria, (as
                in Egypt,) they had a written
                language, numerals, cal calcul
                weights, tables, calculations,
                the financial mediums, and
                dispatches—they had an
                appropriate religion, poetry,
                history, amusements,

                    Niebuhr divined their contents,
