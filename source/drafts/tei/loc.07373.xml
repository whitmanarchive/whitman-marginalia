        <p>ennobling love, it has banished and condemned it. 
            Beauty, woman, and love, could not lose their empire. Men 
            have raised to them other temples which they have called 
            theatres, wherein no other god has come to preside. Is it 
            your fault, Consuelo, if those theatres have become sinks of 
            corruption? Nature, who performs her prodigies, without 
            caring for the reception that her master-pieces may meet with 
            among men, has formed you to shine among all women, and 
            to spread abroad through the earth the treasures of power and 
            of genius. The cloister and the tomb are synonymous. You 
            could not, without committing suicide, bury the gifts of Providence. 
            You were obliged to take your flight in a freer atmos-
            phere. <hi rend="underline">Manifestation is the condition of certain existences;</hi> 
            the voice of nature impels them to it irresistibly; and the will 
            of God in this respect is so positive, that he withdraws the 
            faculties with which he has endowed them, as soon as they 
            mistake their use. The artist perishes and is extinguished in 
            obscurity, as the thinker wanders and is exasperated in absolute 
            solitude; as every human spirit deteriorates and is destroyed 
            in isolation and confinement. Go therefore upon the 
            stage, Consuelo, if you will, and encounter its apparent disgrace 
            with the resignation of a pious soul, destined to suffer, 
            to search in vain for its home in this world, but compelled to 
            fly the darkness which is not the element of its life, and out 
            of which the breath of the Holy Spirit imperiously expels it."</p>
        <p>Albert spoke thus a long while, with animation, walking 
            rapidly with Consuelo through the shadowy paths of the warren. 
            He had no difficulty in communicating to her the enthusiasm 
            he experienced for the sentiment of art, and in making 
            her forget the repugnance she had at first felt at returning to 
            the grotto. Seeing that he desired it earnestly, she herself 
            began to wish to be alone with him long enough to understand 
            the ideas which this ardent and timid man did not dare to 
            utter except before her. Those ideas were very new to Consuelo, 
            and perhaps they were entirely so, in the mouth of a 
            patrician of that age and country. Still they struck the young 
            artist only as a frank and bold expression of the feelings which</p>
