            The idea (illustrated by Kant)
            that it isn't those who travel
            the most that know the most,
            or think the deepest, widest,
                clearest. I even think that
                sometimes a life devoted to
                persistent travel is a squan-
                der'dsquandered life. The Knowingest
                people I have met have
                been not been the gad-abouts
