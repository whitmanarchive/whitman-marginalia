            THE thoughts are strange that crowd into my brain,
            While I look upward to thee. It would seem
            As if GOD pour'd thee from his "hollow hand,"
            And hung his bow upon thine awful front;
            And spoke in that loud voice, which seem'd to him
            Who dwelt in Patmos for his Saviour's sake,
            "The sound of many waters;" and had bade
            Thy flood to chronicle the ages back,
            And notch His cent'ries in the eternal rocks.
            Deep calleth unto deep. And what are we,
            That hear the question of that voice sublime?The 
            Voice
            Oh! what are all the notes that ever rung
            From war's vain trumpet, by thy thundering side!
            Yea, what is all the riot man can make
            In his short life, to thy unceasing roar!

                the doctor departed, and has never been heard of since. It 
                was supposed that he took the carbuncle with him. Thus 
                far was authentic. A little girl, who had anxiously noticed 
                the course of the traveller's inquiries, sung for his further edification 
                the following ballad:
                SEE you upon the lonely moor,
                A crazy building rise?
                No hand dares venture to open the door—
                No footstep treads its dangerous floor—
                No eye in its secrets pries.
                Now why is each crevice stopp'd so tight?
                Say, why the bolted door?
                Why glimmers at midnight the forge's light—
                All day is the anvil at rest, but at night
                The flames of the furnace roar?
                Is it to arm the horse's heel,
                That the midnight anvil rings?
                Is it to mould the ploughshare's steel,
                Or is it to guard the wagon's wheel,
                That the smith's sledge-hammer swings?
             
                    8
                The iron is bent, and the crucible stands
                    With alchymy boiling up; 
                    Its contents were mix'd by unknown hands,
                    And no mortal fire e'er kindled the brands,
                    That heated that corner'd cup.
                O'er Moodus river a light has glanc'd,
                    On Moodus hills it shone;
                        On the granite rocks the rays have danc'd,
                            And upward those creeping lights advanc'd,
                    Till they met on the highest stone.
                O that is the very wizard place,
                    And now is the wizard hour,
                    By the light that was conjur'd up to trace,
                    Ere the star that falls can run its race,
                    The seat of the earthquake's power.
                By that unearthly light, I see
                    A figure strange alone—
                    With magic circlet on his knee,
                    And deck'd with Satan's symbols, he
                    Seeks for the hidden stone.
                
                imprison'd &amp; prostrated
                all the time
                9
                Now upward goes that gray old man,
                    With mattock, bar and spade—
                    The summit is gain'd, and the toil began,
                    And deep by the rock where the wild lights ran,
                    The magic trench is made.
                Loud and yet louder was the groan
                    That sounded wide and far;
                    And deep and hollow was the moan,
                    That roll'd around the bedded stone,
                    Where the workman plied his bar.
                Then upward stream'd the brilliant's light,
                    It stream'd o'er crag and stone:—
                    Dim look'd the stars, and the moon, that night;
                    But when morning came in her glory bright,
                    The man and the jewel were gone.
                But wo to the bark in which he flew
                    From Moodus' rocky shore;
                    Wo to the Captain, and wo to the crew,
                    That ever the breath of life they drew,
                    When that dreadful freight they bore.

                            On his lone grave the careless step shall tread,
                            And pestilential vapours soon shall dry
                            Each shrub that buds around—each flow'r that 
                            blushes nigh.

                            Fill the charm'd air with thy deserved praise:
                            Of war, and blood, and carnage let her sing,
                            Of victory and glory!—let her gaze
                            On the dark smoke that shrouds the cannon's blaze,
                            On the red foam that crests the bloody billow;
                            Then mourn the sad close of thy shorten'd days—
                            Place on thy country's brow the weeping willow,
                            And plant the laurels thick around thy last cold 
                            pillow.
                            No sparks of Grecian fire to me belong:
                                Alike uncouth the poet and the lay;
                                Unskill'd to turn the mighty tide of song,
                                He floats along the current as he may,

            ON THE

                BEHOLD the moss'd corner-stone dropp'd from the 
                wall,points well taken.
                And gaze on its date, but remember its fall,
                And hope that some hand may replace it;
                Think not of its pride when with pomp it was laid,
                But weep for the ruin its absence has made,
                And the lapse of the years that efface it.
                Mourn WASHINGTON'S death, when ye think of his 
                birth,
                And far from your thoughts be the lightness of mirth,
                And far from your cheek be its smile.
                Why not condemn Wash? 
                At least why should he 
                not express himself, just
                   
                24 
                    To-day he was born—'twas a loan—not a gift:
                    The dust of his body is all that is left,
                    To hallow his funeral pile.
                Flow gently, Potomac! thou washest away
                    The sands where he trod, and the turf where he lay,
                    When youth brush'd his cheek with her wing;
                    Breathe softly, ye wild winds, that circle around
                    That dearest, and purest, and holiest ground,
                    Ever press'd by the footprints of Spring.
                Each breeze be a sigh, and each dewdrop a tear,
                    Each wave be a whispering monitor near,
                    To remind the sad shore of his story;
                    And darker, and softer, and sadder the gloom
                    Of that evergreen mourner that bends o'er the tomb,
                    Where WASHINGTON sleeps in his glory.
                Great GOD! when the spirit of freedom shall fail,
                    And the sons of the pilgrims, in sorrow, bewail
                    Their religion and liberty gone;
                    Oh! send back a form that shall stand as he stood,
                    Unsubdu'd by the tempest, unmov'd by the flood;
                    And to THEE be the glory alone.
                
                as he has—and—
                25
                    ON Thursday, the 21st of February, 1823, in the middle of 
                        the day, as the mail stage from Hartford to New-Haven, with 
                        three passengers, was crossing the bridge at the foot of 
                        the hill near Durham, the bridge was carried away by the ice, 
                        and the stage was precipitated down a chasm of twenty feet. 
                        Two of the passengers were drowned: one of them had been 
                        long from home, and was on his way to see his friends. This 
                        occurrence is mentioned as explanatory of the following lines.
                    "How slow we drive! but yet the hour will come,
                        When friends shall greet me with affection's kiss;
                        When, seated at my boyhood's happy home,
                        I shall enjoy a mild, contented bliss,
                        Not often met with in a world like this!
                        Then I shall see that brother, youngest born,
                        I used to play with in my sportiveness;
                        And, from a mother's holiest look, shall learn
                        A parent's thanks to God, for a lov'd son's return.
                    "And there is one, who, with a downcast eye,
                        Will be the last to welcome me; but yet
                        My memory tells me of a parting sigh,
                        And of a lid with tears of sorrow wet,

                        THE sun look'd bright upon the morning tide:
                            Light play'd the breeze along the whispering shore,
                            And the blue billow arch'd its head of pride,
                            As 'gainst the rock its frothy front it bore;
                            The clear bright dew fled hastily before
                            The morning's sun, and glitter'd in his rays;
                            Aloft the early lark was seen to soar,
                            And cheerful nature glorified the ways
                            Of God, and mutely sang her joyous notes of praise.
                        The freshening breeze, the sporting wave.
                            Their own impartial greeting gave
                            To Christian and to Turk;
                            But both prepared to break the charm
                            Of peace, with war's confused alarm—
                            And ready each, for combat warm,
                            Commenc'd the bloody work.

                    AH! who can imagine what plague and what bothers
                        He feels, who sits down to write verses for others!
                        His pen must be mended, his inkstand be ready,
                        His paper laid square, and his intellects steady;
                        And then for a subject—No, that's not the way,
                        For genuine poets don't care what they say,
                        But how they shall say it. So now for a measure,
                        That's suited alike to your taste and my leisure.
                        For instance, if you were a matron of eighty,
                        The verse should be dignified, solemn, and weighty;
                        And luckless the scribbler who had not the tact,
                        To make every line a sheer matter of fact.
                        Or if you were a stiff, worn-out spinster, too gouty
                        To make a good sylph, and too sour for a beauty;
                        Too old for a flirt, and too young to confess it;
                        To good to complain of 't, and too bad to bless it;

            And I have seen
                Yon foundering vessel, when with crowded sail,
                With smoking bulwarks, and with blazing sides,
                Sporting away the foam before her prow,
                And heaving down her side to the brave chase,
                She seem'd to share the glories of the bold!
                But now, with flagging canvass, lazily
                She moves; and stumbling on the rock, she sinks,
                As broken hearted as that faithful steed,
                That lost his rider, and laid down, and died.

            And if death's dark mist shall his eye bedim,

                Beyond the blue seas, far away,
                    Most wretchedly alone,
                    One died in prison—far away,
                    Where stone on stone shut out the day,
                    And never hope, or comfort's ray
                    In his lone dungeon shone.
                Dead to the world, alive to me;
                    Though months and years have pass'd,
                    In a lone hour, his sigh to me
                    Comes like the hum of some wild bee,
                    And then his form and face I see
                    As when I saw him last.
                
                The world, the race, the soul, 
                the universes, 
                All onward wisely  bound   as is befitting them——all surely 
                going 
                somewhere.
                77
                And one with a bright lip, and cheek,
                    And eye, is dead to me.
                    How pale the bloom of his smooth cheek!
                    His lip was cold—it would not speak;
                    His heart was dead, for it did not break;
                    And his eye, for it did not see.
                Then for the living be the tomb,
                    And for the dead the smile;
                    Engrave oblivion on the tomb
                    Of pulseless life and deadly bloom—
                    Dim is such glare: but bright the gloom
                    Around the funeral pile.
                    
                    THE DEEP.
                        There's beauty in the deep:
                            The wave is bluer than the sky;
                            And though the lights shine bright on high,
                            More softly do the sea-gems glow
                            That sparkle in the depths below;
                            The rainbow's tints are only made
                            When on the waters they are laid,
